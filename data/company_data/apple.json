Each interview was an hour spent entirely on technical questions covering algorithms and system design.The first two interviews were not great, but not terrible.\u2026\u00a0 I asked a lot of clarifying questions, which seemed to annoy the interviewers more than anything. Weird.The worst interview I've ever had was the 3rd one, with the two team leads. One of them wrote up a problem on the whiteboard, and then spent the rest of the interview looking bored out of his mind at his phone. His problem was very vague and incomplete as he first asked it, and when I asked questions about it he got frustrated and talked down to me. He would occasionally glance up at my progress (it wasn't a hard problem once the details were worked out) and make a snide remark about what I had written. He expected syntactically perfect whiteboard code, and threw in some expletives for an added bonus. The other interviewer would snicker whenever the first criticized my code. At the end they asked if I had any questions, but every question I asked was met with, \"That's confidential.\" It was definitely the most unprofessional interview I've ever been a part of, and I almost walked out of it because it was clear it was wasting all of our time.Unfortunately the misery didn't quite end there, as it took Apple three full months (and 13 reminder emails) to reimburse me for the costs I had to pay for cab rides and per diem expenses. I was also never reimbursed for a flight I had to cancel because of the interview timing, but at this point I'm just tired of dealing with them. If possible, try to get Apple to pay up front for as much stuff as possible, because the reimbursement process is a nightmare.

I was in a technical interview for a future job. However, these interviewers treated me as a Customer support engineer sent by my current employer company to service Apple. They asked me many BS questions like \"how is XXX feature implemented\" and then blame me that something was poorly implemented and why it was the case. Oh man, I am not the architect for those features, blaming me couldn't help anything! Oh yes, blaming the interviewee gave the Apple interviewers a great sense of accomplishment, that Apple is greater than anyone else on this planet!When it was my turn to ask questions to them, oh sorry, the spirit of keeping things secret is in the bone of Apple's culture, nothing could be discussed. I have to say that interviewing with Apple is BORING, because I have to answer a lot of BS questions and get blamed for nothing, while I couldn't ask any technical question about Apple at all because everything is secret.Given that Apple's interviewers are so ignorant, so rude, and are in lack of diversity, I will not apply for any job at Apple in the future.",

I\u2026\u00a0 am baffled at the outcome - rejected by both teams with no feedback.

After giving my availability and almost after 3 weeks, they get back saying they want another phone interview. I agreed. Almost immediately after the phone interview, I was rejected. It is not hard to connect the dots and see that they had made the decision already. Moreover, they asked for another round of interview after the first 2 team rejects. It is again not hard to see that, well, the process of multiple team interviewing is not independent.One team asked me to code in coderpad.io. The code I wrote was right but the interviewer only used c++ compiler. The same code worked perfect on C compiler. I sent a note after the interview. But guess what, reject anyway.",

        "details": "I was contacted by an Apple recruiter asking if I'd be interested in a specific engineering position. After a technical phone interview with the hiring manager, I was invited on-site for a full day of interviews.A trip coordinator at Apple sent me a link to their booking intranet that allowed me to book my flights, hotel, and rental car. This was great because it allowed me to tweak the travel\u2026\u00a0 exactly how I liked it.On the day of the interview, the recruiter met with me to give me an overview of the process and explain the benefits.The on-site interviews consisted of six back-to-back technical interviews that involved whiteboard coding exercises ranging from traversing binary search trees to software architecture and everything in between.The interviewers were all very bright and courteous. They asked great questions and when I got stuck, they gave me small bits of information that helped me get to the final solution. Though there were a couple questions that I really struggled with, I was able to arrive at a solution for every problem.Lunch was with my future manager and in the Apple cafeteria---paid for by Apple. The cafeteria is really impressive. They have several ethnicities represented with food served just as beautifully as their products. The lunch interview consisted mainly of resume clarifications, general behavioral questions, and a chance for me to ask the questions that I had.After the final interview, I said goodbye to the recruiter and the hiring manager and left for home.I was contacted the next day by the recruiter letting me know that the interview feedback was very positive and that they'd like to send me an offer. Once the details were ironed out, I accepted immediately.Here are some pointers to potential interviewees:1. Make sure you know basic algorithms and data structures. You should be familiar with hash tables, linked lists, binary search trees, etc. You should also know how to search and traverse each data structure.2. You should know Apple. Show your love and enthusiasm for the brand.3. Don't spout off about things that you aren't fully knowledgeable about. You'll get asked clarifying questions and will look like a fool if you were just talking to look good. Make sure you can back any opinions you give with factual evidence.4. Rehearse the typical behavioral questions. You should be prepared to answer things like \"why do you want to work for Apple?\" or \"Have you ever had an experience where x happened?\".5. Your attitude should be one of humility and eagerness to learn. You'll quickly realize that you're not the smartest person in the room. Be polite and humble.",

        "details": "I interviewed for multiple positions over a span of an year before we settled on a position. The \"process took\" timeframe below is for the latest interview cycle which resulted in an offer being made. Without identifying the group / team by name, all I can say is that this division deals within a specific domain and as such, the talent pool is limited to recruit from.Mid-'12. The first interview\u2026\u00a0 (on phone), as always with Apple, was with the Hiring Manager. The interviewer was very pleasant and the questioning mainly revolved around my background and skills. Even though the interview as scheduled for 30 minutes, the Manager cut it short and told me he will follow up with me within a day. The second interview (on site) ran for about five hours and consisted 1:1 interview sessions with various Managers, Senior Analysts & Engineers and the Recruiter. The Managers, Analysts and Engineers who interviewed me were pretty professional and represented different departments. The questioning, like the phone interview, focused on problem solving abilities and approach rather than the solution itself. The Hiring Manager hosted a Lunch Interview. The last session for the day was with the Recruiter who asked me about my salary expectations and the usual HR stuff.The following day the Recruiter reached out to me and let me know that they were not interested in considering me further at that point of time. The whole process took about three weeks.Late-'12. The Recruiter reached out to me about a new position that would be a good fit to my skill sets. The first interview (on phone) was the customary Hiring Manager interview. The second interview (on site) was slightly shorter (four hours) than my last visit to Apple Campus. The interview consisted 1:1 interview sessions with various Managers and Analysts & Engineers. The questions were domain specific and revolved around problems and challenges that are typically encountered by someone working in these areas of expertise. The next day, I was told that the feedback was extremely positive and I was scheduled to speak with the Director. Since this was around the Holidays, my 1:1 with the Group Director got delayed. The third and last interview (on phone) was with the Director and mainly revolved around why I wanted to work for Apple and how do I think that I am good position. The Director had considerable domain knowledge. Unlike most Director-level interviews, this interview was fairly technical.Within couple of days, the Recruiter reached back to me to let me know that, as of then, they would not be able to make an offer and they would have to hold off on hiring me. While no specific reason was attributed, I was let known that the group was impressed with my skills and the process would resume soon. This time around the whole process took about six weeks.Early-'13. After waiting for couple of months, I reached back to Apple about resuming the previous process. I also let them know my keen interest in couple of positions that had opened up recently. The Recruiter followed up with a Coding Homework to regauge my technical skills. Once I was done solving, the Recruiter promptly scheduled an 1:1 interview with the Hiring Manager. The first interview (on phone) was soon followed second and last interview (on site). The on site Lunch Interview was just with the Hiring Manager. They skipped over technical rounds based on the homework solutions and my past interview feedbacks. By the time the final interview was scheduled, the group had, more or less, made up their minds about hiring me. The final session was basically about what they envisioned for the position they were hiring and if I am truly interested in joining them.The Recruiter emailed me the following business day and let me know that they were ready to make an offer. This was followed couple of email and phone calls to finalize the offer & package.Here are couple of tips based on my experience and from what I have heard from folks who have undergone the same process.* Never \"wing\" it. I realized it the hard way. Engineers questioning you know their stuff and can easily make out if you know things or if you are just guessing.* The on site interviews are exhausting. Make sure you are hydrated and well rested. Interviewers, as a matter of process, will not offer you a water / restroom break unless you ask for it.* For a technology giant, some of the processes are still \"old-style\". No t-shirts or jeans for the interviews. Candidates are expected to show up in business casuals.* Like most things Apple, the Managers, Analysts and Engineers are very secretive. They'll never tell you what they are working on and the expectation is for you to illustrate solutions based on your current job.* On a lighter note, the food available in Caffe Macs are gourmet, personalized and highly economical. Apple will provide you with a \"Food Coupon\" which will be more than sufficient to cover your lunch, twice over.",

        "details": "I appeared for a college interview with Apple. The technical part of the interview was fine: there were no trick questions. One of the questions was to actually write C code for some string manipulation. The interviewer also asked me if I used Mac OS, and what I thought was annoying about it. We had a good discussion about the technical and user-side limitations of Mac OS X. The technical\u2026\u00a0 interview was fine.The real disaster was the HR interaction. Right after the interview, the HR person gave me an iTunes gift card...for $1. A. Single. Dollar. I thought it was a joke, and I told the person to keep it. I wasn't an iTunes user anyway, and I thought a gift card for a single dollar was borderline insulting. It would have been better not to offer anything. After the interview, I waited for a response. I received a call that my interview had gone well, and they were interested in getting me on-site (Cupertino) for interviews, then I got some conflicting email saying that on-site interviews wouldn't be required. This was for an internship, and most bay-area companies don't bother with onsite interviews for summer internship. In the meanwhile, I had interviewed with Google, and they had offered me a position. I emailed my recruiter at Apple, and got no response back. I accepted the Google offer. A week or two later, I get a frantic call from some other Apple recruiter, saying how they'd love to have me over. Alas, by then it was too late.I suspect Apple expects candidates, especially college students, to wait for them.",

        "details": "I was interviewed for Software Engineer in Singapore for Emerging Technologies team.Phone interview as first engagement, which was more like background check and some technical proficiency assesment. To see where you're good at. Then moving on to onsite interview, I have 4 rounds back-to-back.First meeting with the recruiter - to get your current career view and asking about salary. Then second round, interviewer was late for half an hour so\u2026\u00a0 i had to call the recruiter again. They are asking about Java, security (PKI, authentication, encryption) concepts, and Linux commands to check cpu stat, search open port remotely, etc. At this round, the interviewer demands lots of answers for exact filenames (e.g to configure tomcat, sysctl file name) which gets very frustrating. I think some people who works more on other technologies will find it very hard even though they understand the how-tos. They also dont answer questions related to the roles and impose secrecy and \"you will know if you join\" notion, rude. Third interview is more to understand on the networking and core java, sql knowledge. I find it very helpful if you prepare for reviewing tcp udp concepts, read java books for basics. Fourth interview, is again a general question regarding many topics like Java, shell scripting, sql.Second onsite interview, i am faced with the hiring manager. In here we spoke more about the work i've done, explain some server architectural concepts and design. I guess they want to access your knowledge vs their setup and see if things match. He said it will be another interview for final round.Then finally 3rd and final round is with engineering director (hiring manager's boss). Here it is more to speak your background and why you want to leave your job, he is accompanied by one technical person in my case. I guess he is there to assess and help if there is some technical concepts to verify. The director then speaks more about the vision for the team and assess your knowledge on scaling your deployment.BUT after last interview, NO NEWS whether i'm accepted or not, nada zilch. The recruiter have contacted me once to checkup for the expected details, buy no news after even with follow up several times. I'm terribly disappointed with this kind of behavior from Apple. Really. At least information of the outcome if its bad news/problems with some requirements. This is the least courtesy you can do. I'm not sure what is held back for, this is true even for poor candidate.",

        "details": "- I submitted my resume to the Grace Hopper Celebration database, and it was forwarded to multiple Apple recruiters who were looking for New Grad candidates.- Each team at Apple has its own designated recruiter, and because my resume was distributed to many teams, I ended up doing a number of phone screens. The phone screens usually were not difficult because they were only 30 minutes long. They mostly tested\u2026\u00a0 knowledge based trivia questions along with asking about your past work experiences and projects. It was pretty overwhelming because multiple recruiters were trying to contact me, all from Apple, but it felt ridiculous having to do so many phone screens that all essentially looked for the same skill sets. They even had a recruiter that just started her job, who contacted me by the wrong name and wrote down the wrong information about me, which I felt was fairly unprofessional and disorganized.- Because there were many teams in contact with me, they hired a single POC recruiter to manage my onsite, which really helped. Scheduling an onsite during the fall is a bit difficult because Apple gives their employees the entire Thanksgiving week off, and many people go on vacation during December. Anyways, I ended up scheduling it and was told I would have 4 2-on-1 interviews. It turned out to be 8 45-min interviews for 4 different teams and I didn't find out until I had a \"break\" when a hiring manager came to talk to me. Thinking back, it was probably the most mentally stressful day of my life. Note that I probably could have split it up into two days, but because I had other obligations, I asked for a single day interview.- In terms of question style, most teams liked to focus on problem solving and algorithmic questions, covering data structures, trees, graph search, etc. one of the teams asked me to find bugs in a piece of code. Another team really focused on class design and asked me to describe the architecture one of my past projects.- Although I was offered breaks in between the interviews, I felt pressured not to take them to keep everyone on schedule. It was also really tough doing so much talking throughout the day (literally met with 16 people that day). My performance was likely diminishing as the day went on, and I knew I didn't do too well on some of the interviews.- The overall feel of the Cupertino office: the building I was placed in was beautiful. The cafes serve extraordinary food and the people I talked to were very smart and sounded like they were doing exciting work. As often noted, Apple is pretty secretive even internally. Some teams I talked to say they do code review through email, which I found pretty strange.- In the end I did not move on to the next round (which would be another onsite for whichever teams were still interested). Overall, I wish that Apple had a more generalized interviewing process for New Grads. The disorganization really displays how segregated Apple is as a company.",

Some questions involving heap, stack, how you use stack in your programs, when\u2026\u00a0 did you use it etc. He then moved on to O.S questions. He asked about some O.S-specific questions, which were, presumably, common topics for the course. But I haven't taken the course, so I failed to answer any of them. He was very friendly though, and encouraged me to guess and try to deduce what it is.Seems like they are looking for people who can think on their feet, and have had some experience outside the classroom.

I explained to the recruiter that in order for me to switched jobs the position had to appeal me and so he said I was going to be\u2026\u00a0 interviewing for a Display Controller role, which of course I wasn't that excited about, then he said that there were more positions opening up and that I could interview for any of them, so I agreed after I saw a Software Engineering role. The recruiter scheduled the phone interview a week later and he said the manager of one of the teams was going to do the interview. To be honest I really prepared for this phone interview and I concentrated on generic Computer Graphics concepts, Operating System concepts and C++ concepts, and to my surprise that were exactly the topics we covered during the interview. To my surprised though the manager of the team didn't show up but rather a technical lead with a very strong asian accent, so I was asking to repeat himself on my occasions. In general I thought I did a decent interview as I was fully prepared yet he thought I wasn't really a good fit for the position; I had the feeling because they were so desperately trying to fill the display controller role for which I already said no, yet during the phone interview the tech lead guy did ask me if I was interested on that role!",

        "details": "Have had several interviews with Apple (for new grad/intern), here's what I've gathered.Process-HR doesn't communicate very well (or at all) with other HR reps. Apply for multiple positions (if applicable).-You'll do an initial phone screen with the \"Manager\". Followed by 2-3 (3 is typical), with engineers within that team. From there, they'll do a full-day onsite grilling fest.-Interviews are very scripted and directed. Probably due to the sheer amount of\u2026\u00a0 candidates, questions tend to be very generic and/or involve classical responses.-It's typical for them to be late/tired or rushed. Honestly, this alone sends the wrong signals.-Very little communication regarding applicant status. Be assertive. Rule of thumb is, if you fail to hear back within the next couple of days, it's not happening.Materials-It varies.-Some interviews like to play the syntactic pop trivia question game (what's a static member, memory segments, etc). Be warned, sometimes the question doesn't have a \"easy/clean\" answer (i.e. impL specific).-Situational answers (If you pissed off a co-worker...etc), not as frequent.-Some behavioral (not typical).-Most of it is problems. Study data structures, algorithms, and classical approaches to typical CS related situations (How do you think spell check is impL? Complexity of a phone queue? Real life deadlock?).-Questions seem to be regurgitated and/or spun off classical questions.Responses/Feedback-You won't get ANY feedback.-Asking about culture, motivations, is probably a waste of time.-Be honest, concise, & elaborate if needed, and say. \"I dont know\" if you... don't know.Overall-I love Apple as a company. I love their products. But the HR dept seems be borderline laughable. I think it's the quantity over quality issue (in screening). Canned rejection responses are typical, and I wouldn't sweat not getting the gig. You can easily try in another area. I feel the HR department is nearly a reflection of the company within, and I'm by no means impressed.",

        "details": "The recruiter contacted me regarding a role I should have, at least at the surface level, been very qualified for, given previous professional experience for a competitor. After a few e-mail exchanges and a phone screening with the recruiter, a call was set up with the hiring manager. If it was the recruiter's intention to get me hired, it would have been wise to provide better details regarding the type\u2026\u00a0 of person/expertise the team was looking for. Advertising a search for a particular skill set but really wanting a different set led to an unfortunately unrewarding phone interview with the hiring manager, from my side, and a waste of time for the hiring manager. Whether the fault lies with a lack of communication between the recruiter and the hiring manager or the recruiter and the prospective candidate (me), the pivotal role here is the recruiter.",
