I took 2 hours to complete the coding challenge and responded to the Recruiter's email. With no greeting or feedback on the results, she told me \"Let's chat\".We schedule a time for a brief phone interview with the HR. I thought that this\u2026\u00a0 would be an informal interview and so I agreed. It just so happened at that time I had to drive to my work. I was in the car when she called and I picked up. I chatting with her on speaker, which was pretty difficult and she asked me for the number of bits in 1000 and the number of times you would have to binary search to find an element from 0 - 1000.I told her I was not by a computer and did not have a paper to work on the question but explained step by step how you would compute the answer, the appropriate runtime, and the concepts behind binary search, but she insisted on having the exact answer. I did some math in my head and responded to her about 9 - 10 searches in the worse case to find an element between 0 - 1000. She then proceeded to ask me to tell her the binary representation of 1000. It is quite difficult to calculate this in your head. I told her it would approximately be a series of 1's from the left to right side, ending in a couple 0's. That was the best I could do with some mental math. I asked her if we could reschedule another time to chat, but at that time the interview was already over.I emailed her a couple hours later with the answer to her questions and explaining my situation, but she really did not care less about my candidacy or about the thought process.The only thing she cared about was the correct answer. It was a poor experience and a very bad interview question asked by the recruiter.This experience reflected badly on me, (had an emergency but should have scheduled for a time where I was by a computer), reflected badly on Palantir, and on my recruiter (asking questions where she didn't fully understand the concept herself and just expected candidates to recite google-searched or memorized results on the spot).This is not what engineering should be, nor how recruiting should be done. This was a terrible experience and as a top tier company, I hope that Palantir takes time to educate their recruiters and improves their interview methodologies.",

The list is sorted in ascending order by time.Your job is to return a list of people's names whose accounts reflect\u2026\u00a0 suspicious activity. A person's account reflects suspicious activity if you see of the following:1. A transaction spending more than $30002. A transaction for which the next transaction for the same person differs in location, and is less than an hour laterThe list you return should be ordered by when the first suspicious was detected. For the second type of fraud, consider the \"first suspicious activity\" to be the earlier of the two transactions.You have to complete the function getSuspiciousActivity to return the list of suspicious activities. The list you return should contain the person names as they appeared in the input. Please note that the first line of the input is the number of transactions in the array.Sample Input 1:Shilpa|500|California|63Tom|25|New York|615Krasi|9000|California|1230Tom|25|New York|1235Tom|25|New York|1238Shilpa|50|Michigan|1300Matt|90000|Georgia|1305Jay|100000|Virginia|1310Krasi|49|Florida|1320Krasi|83|California|1325Shilpa|50|California|1350Sample Output 1:KrasiShilpaMattJayExplanationKrasi is first because she has exhibited amount fraud before any other account exhibited either types of fraud (she then later also committed location fraud, but this doesn't matter). Shilpa is second, having committed location fraud where the first transaction took place before either of Matt or Jay's amount fraud. Matt and Jay both exhibited amount fraud, but Matt's fraud was recorded before Jay's. Tom is not on this list because he did not commit either type of fraud. \u00a0"

            "There is only one coding problem given 100min. The problem is as below:A group of farmers has some elevation data, and we\u2019re going to help them understand how rainfall flows over their farmland.We\u2019ll represent the land as a two-dimensional array of altitudes and use the following model, based on the idea that water flows downhill:If a cell\u2019s four neighboring cells all have higher altitudes, we call this cell a sink;\u2026\u00a0 water collects in sinks.Otherwise, water will flow to the neighboring cell with the lowest altitude. If a cell is not a sink, you may assume it has a unique lowest neighbor and that this neighbor will be lower than the cell.Cells that drain into the same sink \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 are said to be part of the same basin.Your challenge is to partition the map into basins. In particular, given a map of elevations, your code should partition the map into basins and output the sizes of the basins, in descending order.Assume the elevation maps are square. Input will begin with a line with one integer, S, the height (and width) of the map. The next S lines will each contain a row of the map, each with S integers \u2013 the elevations of the S cells in the row. Some farmers have small land plots such as the examples below, while some have larger plots. However, in no case will a farmer have a plot of land larger than S = 1000.Note: The input uses unix line endings (\\n). If you try to view the sample inputs on a windows machine with a program that does not convert line endings (like Notepad), you will see the input appear all on a single line.Your code should output a space-separated list of the basin sizes, in descending order. (Trailing spaces are ignored.)While correctness and performance are the most important parts of this problem, a human will be reading your solution, so please make an effort to submit clean, readable code.

Most of their technical questions start off fairly standard -- but at the point\u2026\u00a0 where most companies stop asking you to improve your solution, Palantir goes further. I don't think I've had to pull out dynamic programming in an interview with any other company.During the phone interviews you're expected to code up your solutions on a computer while you're talking with your interviewer, I actually enjoyed this quite a bit. The onsite interview consisted of questions I had never heard before, I had been interviewing all year long and most of them were boiler-plate, but Palantir had quite a few curve balls.They were very fast with feedback, after each interview I didn't have to wait longer than a week before hearing whether or not I was advancing. At the end of the onsite interview I was asked to meet one of the founders. A week later they asked me to do a skype interview with another founder and shortly after I received a phone call extending me an offer.All the employees I talked to at the company seemed very happy, Palantir seems to have a very open and collaborative atmosphere among its engineers. Also, it seems that they are incredibly flexible with working hours, which was a big selling point when I was making my decision.

By the third interview and lunch I felt very negatively about the company and didn't particularly wanted to work there. This sense/feeling carried into the 4th and last interview. Knowing that if I didn't get to meet the CEO at the end of the day, I didn't get the job, I was happy to be done. The HR lady was very friendly and attractive, I probably should have asked her for her number. The lunch was okay but disappointing... it was baked potatoes.",

There were four interviews: algorithms, distributed systems, design, and an algorithms question. None seemed super difficult - the questions were definitely easier than experienced at AMZ, FB, and GOOG. Palantir pride themselves in the press with claims of the hardest interview, but it didn't feel like the case.There were likely a couple of stumbling blocks in the interviews that could have been reason for reject. One of the interviewers was quite hostile from the outset and that interview didn't feel good or draw the candidate to the company. One of the algorithms question was binary (you either knew the solution or were going to struggle, not many opportunities for exploration/discussion).Most people on the loop seemed pretty fresh out of college, energetic, and still developing. Cool office and great lunch. There was no feedback beyond the rejection and no expense re-imbursal. I didn't get an offer, but that was a relief to be honest.",
