The day was split 4 hours each with a lunch in the middle where I could talk to both managers at the same time.After this day, I was given a few weeks to make my decision.

She was a neutral party unaffialited with the\u2026\u00a0 department I would be interviewing with. She gave a breif overview of the company and what the position would be. After confirming I was still interested I continued to phase 2.Next was a discussion with the hiring manager. This was not technical at all; mostly a meet and greet for both parties. I was asked mostly about my background and what I why I wished to work for the company. The manager shared some details about how the department operates and what I would be doing if I were to accept the offer.Phase 3 was the technical interview. I had expected a number of whiteboard style questions but there was a distinct lack of them. I had already sent in some code samples of a game that I had created previously. The most technical questions related to the reason why I had made certain design choices when designing the code for the game. After that, the questions become more about myself and why I was passionate about technology and to see if I really enjoyed working in this field. Once I believe the interviewer was satisfied with my ability the interview became less about one way questions and more about free flowing conversation to see if I would mesh well with the team. Shortly after this interview the hiring manager called to let me know that they would be extending an offer to me soon.The experience was a very positive one.",

I asked if they had the right person and they responded with my name. I was surprised to say the least and explained to them how I was told to try again next year a couple weeks ago and ask why I was being approached now. They said that after looking over my application, they thought I would be a great fit.I declined on the spot over the phone because I had already accepted an offer a week earlier.There were no interviews (save for my conversation at the career fair), no questions other than the aptitude test, just an offer out of the blue.",
