Then he asked me about some things on my resume (which language was my favorite and why, etc.).

Then came the more technical part of the interview. I was asked to tell him what I would ask a customer (to determine requirements) about a tic-tac-toe game they want me to make. Then I was asked what kind of design I would use and what languages I would use to do it in. Finally I was asked how I would test it.

They spent 45 minutes asking fairly detailed technical questions about C, Unix, and SQL to make sure I actually knew that stuff. Plus I took online assessments in C and SQL so that they had fairly objective measures of my understanding of those. (I got high scores on both.) Then when I arrive at the job, it turns out\u2026\u00a0 that all of that is about 99% irrelevant. The job itself is mostly production support. Have to keep large batch data processing procedures that run day and night going. And almost no training in their overly complex and confusing technical/bureaucratic systems and controls. Training consisted of a two-hour session in a conference room where a senior technical person kept going \"Oh, and one more thing I forgot to mention. Oh, and here's something else I should have mentioned already.\" There is extensive online (on their internal network) documentation and training materials for this project, however most of it is from years ago and is completely out of date and inaccurate. Communication is done almost entirely through PCs (IMs and E-mail through their internal network) and conference phone calls. This is largely because about half of my immediate team (4 out of 8 people) are not located here but in other cities and states. Even people who sit in adjacent cubicles usually communicate electronically rather than talking face-to-face. My own cubicle feels like a solitary confinement cell in a prison. I am a contractor who is paid by the hour, and not much, either. As a contractor I get paid only for time that I'm physically in the office (even though regular employees work remotely or from home over the Internet all the time). I get no time off (when there is a day off for a holiday I have to work extra long shifts the rest of the week to make up my billable hours) and no benefits, and still have to be available to support production runs 24/7, which makes it hard to look for other employment or take a part-time job or or take a training class off-hours (since I can be be interrupted by a phone call about a production glitch at any time), not to mention the effect this schedule has on one's family life. I do not get any feeling that I am contributing to anything that matters in the long run. The only motivation is not to screw up so as to at least keep the paychecks coming.",

All the languages plus networking?When we said the paper has the questions from all C,C++ and Java the interviewers were like Oh! Is it? We don't know.Anyway, I got through the written round. Then one after the other they took 6 technical interviews. I luckily got through all the rounds. In the 6th round, they told me I am selected and my HR round will be on the phone and it will only be about the negotiation of the salary. In the 6th round itself, they asked me my expected salary. I think they don't pay the salary I expected.And I never received a call for the HR round from them for the negotiation.The overall experience was bad.

I found MySql the easiest one they gave basic queries based on the tables eg. Schema of two tables with a question and the query was in one of the options. It was quite easy.C++ : most of the questions were on C++ they give you a code snippet and you need to find the output I found it a little tedious. You have to be really good at C++.C : It was not as tough as C++ and not too easy also. The problems were again on code snippets.( I wasn't able to clear the 1st round but one of my friend got through it and that person was selected for this position so I am sharing the further rounds acc. to my friend's experience. I must say they would have kept the cut off really high since they selected 2-5 candidates from the batch of 150-200 people.
