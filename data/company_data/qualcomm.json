As i have written for Software profile i got questions mainly on Operating Systems..ECE its better to learn some more concepts rather than sticking to those which are thaught to you,i think its better to say which in ur syllabus..PERSONAL INTERVIEW (TECHNICAL)As all interviewers the one who interviewed me is also very cool and friendly.Checked my resume from top to bottom and then said that i have good track record.As i have kept al the projects,interns and workshops i have atteneded and even i have kept the details of the 2 IEEE papers i have..So ppl who have published papers can thoughtlessly keep them in their resume for Qualcomm..I think the interviewer was very much impressed with my resume itself.he asked about my fav subject and i said DS and oops..1)So he asked me to tell the algo of finding the kth largest number from the array with N numbers..i said that i will use a max heap and he asked me why only max heap and why not other then i said the advantages of it and he accepted..2)He then asked me how will the find the missing number in array having N numbers..I said the obvious answer with N time complexity and said ok.3)then he asked me about my papers and i explained them.Then i was passed to next round.which is also not that tough..Even this guy checked my resume as his father's will and then asked me to introduce myself and then asked me to1)Write the code for String reversal2)Code for reversing 2 nodes in Likned list if a pointer to only the first node among them was given..it seems to be simple but there is a problem in that u dont have the pointer to the node prev to the first node which is required.So i asked whether that pointer is provided or not.As his intention is not to miss it..he thought for some tym and said good question and said you know that pointr and i have written the simple code for reversal and said the algo how to reverse them even if the prev node pntr is not given.After this he asked me about my internship and papers and asked for much more detailed explaination and i did..Thats all for 2nd round..PERSONAL INTERVIEW (HR)The interviewer for this round is she..She wished me as i entered the room and introduce herself and the first question is have you done any intern.I said yes and she asked me to tell about myself and about my papers and projects..Even she asked about the extra cults i have mentioned in my resume like my blog,short films etc..and then asked me if i want to know anything about QualComm for which i was waiting and fired few questions...It was 1 in the midnight when my interviews are over..and i am confident enough that i will be selected and waited for the result till 1 30 and yes i was.",
