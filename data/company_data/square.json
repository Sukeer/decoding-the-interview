        "details": "Square does a really good job on the process. E-mails are promptly replied and recruiters are very friendly. Two initial phone interviews with developers were set up very quickly. They were very friendly and we got the problems solved in time and efficiently. After that I was invited to the SF office for the on-site. 3 pairing interviews with coding and other interviews focus on more on other aspects of\u2026\u00a0 the company and the candidate. Most interviewers were very friendly and professional.However, here ends the good story. A coding interviewer let me know that he is having a bad morning. The coding problem itself was not very complicated, but I could feel he is not particularly enjoying to interview. I felt as if I am responsible for his bad mood. He was constantly looking at his watch and counting the minutes instead of actually discussing with me the problem and the approach chosen. He seem to have no interest whatsoever interviewing or assessing the candidate.Another thing I was very concerned about was the actual \"pair programming\". I could tell they use it for interviewing purposes. Once hired you seem to rarely pair with someone. Thus the interview is more described as \"code while someone is watching over your shoulders and making notes on every mistype you make\". I guess \"pair programming\" sounded better than \"technical interview\". But in this case there is no difference.My final thoughts and advice: If someone is 'sharing' his unstable mood with you on the interview, there is definitely something wrong. This was a very BIG WARNING SIGNAL for me. I personally think Square is still a good company, but maybe they should focus stronger on people they choose for the interviews than replying feedbacks on glassdoor.",

        "details": "Overall Square's interview process was fairly standard. They try to improve upon the process, and in some ways they do, but overall it falls short of what they're trying to do. For the most part it comes down to luck (who you get to interview you) and memorization. With 3 coding interviews and 2 technical discussion (and a talk with the manager) this is a test of endurance.Process: The interview\u2026\u00a0 process is \"pair programming\". The issue is they leave it up to the interviewer to determine how to implement that. Out of the four programming exercises I had I would say only one was true pair programming. The other mostly sat there taking notes and semi engaged (or slightly bored?). So expect more of a whiteboard session with an IDE and Google. After the coding you'll have open ended discussion with people on various teams. This isn't tough but after 3 hours of coding with 3 separate people it can be tough to be engaged.Questions: Despite what I read here most of my questions were variants of pretty standard interview questions. Design this, manipulate that, find this, etc, etc. Nothing was too difficult but they're not things you do in the real world and not something I can solve and implement while still entertaining the interviewer in the hour given. So memorize basic implementations of standard problems so you can spend your mental energy engaging the interviewer with your coding presentation.I would say my experience was fairly negative but I'll give props to a slightly better interview experience than other companies. I didn't get a confirmation of my onsite until the night before (but had been in contact with the recruiter so I knew things were still on). Out of the four coding interviewers I worked with one was fantastic, two were fine (took notes, not much feedback or engagement), and one was probably among my top worst interviewers. The interview is a full day which is pretty exhausting and works against most people (also makes it hard for people who already have a job).",

I came in with a group of six or seven other potential interns, and the first hour or two was a tour, history of Square, and lunch.

This was fairly straightforward. Then, he asked to parse a list of expressions instead of just one. Then, some expressions could reference others in the list (e.g. A3 + 1) which was as far as we got. I successfully wrote the code but I think he was displeased with my messy design as it was \"patched through\" on the initial design. Eventually the recruiter informed me that I need to do another coderpad session.The second interview was much like the first. The problem this time was to write a class scheduler, where each class could have multiple time slots and we need to choose a combination of times so that we can take each class. I tried this time to focus on designing it properly in OO but it took so much time that I was only able to reach one evolution of the problem - return all possible arrangements instead of just the first.

The process was fun, based on the fact that you can write code on an actual computer, and run it. At the end of the day I got the chance to have a more informal conversation with one of the managers and learn more about the company and possible roles.\u2026\u00a0 I received an offer a few days later.",

Recruiter was very professional, on time and kept me in the loop.Interview consisted of several pair-programming sessions. Moderate head-scratchers but almost all of them were relevant. As a software engineer .. I thought that the pair-programming sessions were much better than white-board sessions that other companies have.After the pair-programming sessions there were interviews with HW managers and the VP\u2026\u00a0 of HW.The process was great. I didn't see any attitude issues that you see in web-companies. Great bunch of people.",
