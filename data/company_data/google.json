We\u2019re interested in your skills and do check for cheating, so please don\u2019t use your professors\u2019, coworkers\u2019, or friends\u2019 solutions or any other external resource\u2026\u00a0 for coming up with your answers to the survey or coding questions.\" So I used zero external resources. No documentation. Nothing. I thought this was appropriate since you don't get to look up docs during a whiteboard interview.The algorithms themselves were simple. The really, really hard part was not having access to documentation-- one can conjure up algorithms with just one's mind and maybe a pencil and some paper, but it is near impossible to conjure up the correct libraries and methods out of thin air.After an incredibly hard time guessing method names and the like, my time ran out and I was only on the first problem. I completed the problem on my own, using documentation-- 'twas a breeze. I thought to myself, \"It seems silly that an easy problem should be made so difficult by lack of documentation.\" I contacted someone at Google and asked them to confirm that \"any other external resources\" included documentation. I was disheartened and surprised to find out that documentation was perfectly okay to use.I told them what had happened and they denied me a second chance but assured me that it wasn't a problem and that everything would be okay if I tried my best...So I was obviously rejected. It's silly, but it's my fault that I had not spoken up before I started the sample. I just thought \"any other external resources\" really meant just that and that there would be no exceptions to it.",

In my case it was night and day\u2026\u00a0 between the two, the first time was crazy; half way into the process fire-alarm went off, one interviewer was late and came in about to collapse and one spent the first half searching his phone for a question.

With one of my interviewers I got 2 questions I already solved (not with google) so I told him I already got it and verbally explained the solution [don't hesitate to do this, honesty is valued].A few pointers:1.)

Verbally state that you're trying to see if there's a better solution (again don't idle to long), ask the interviewer if they thing a better solution exist or if they have any other questions or just say that you're done.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-If asked for operation cost, it's rarely o(n), but the problem will give the illusion of it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-When asked 'what data structure,' be aware they may be asking for a combination like linked list and hash map for quick modification and iteration.2.) Be familiar with collection structures and their methods for your chosen language including the string object.3.) Don't be afraid to isolate things that are more busy work and not at the core of the problem such as asking the interviewer to assume a certain helper methods exist (they obviously have to agree to it first)4.) If you realize you're solution fails, let the interviewer know and why it does and either rework it or start over (it happens). Hoping your interviewer didn't notice is the worst thing to try..... you can probably guess some of these pointers come from some stumbling points that I ran into. I'm planning another round with these guys in 6 months.",

Here was that process:- phone interview with HR (really just review what to expect)- technical phone interview with engineer- onsite technical interviews (4) and one lunch interviewI felt I performed poorly on at least one of\u2026\u00a0 onsite technical interviews, and I felt two went really well. I felt all the material was extremely fair given review materials/advice provided by my recruiter. I was notified shortly after (1 week or so) that I would not be moving forward in the process.Fast forward two years, and I was contacted by a recruiter asking if I would like to re-apply. Went through the exact same process, however, this time I was approved by the hiring committee after my onsite interviews. I did not have any memorable \"OMG I BLEW IT\" moments during my onsite technical interviews; however, I did not reach optimal solutions for each problem and also made various, small mistakes here and there. After matching with a manager and finally being approved by the executive hiring committee, I was extended an offer.My advice to anyone applying is to always stay positive! Re-applying is always an option after a rejection. I felt that getting prepared the second time around was much easier; all of my prep from undergrad helped me get back up to speed with algorithms/data structures/ etc much quicker than I anticipated. Additionally, each time I interviewed I felt all the questions were extremely fair; the recruiters do a good job of giving you an idea of the material you'll need to know. Do your prep, relax, listen to your interviewer, and you'll to great!",

The first was a design question. It was intentionally severely underspecified. I had to design object-oriented data structures and an algorithm to solve the problem. Once I solved it the interviewer upped the difficulty by changing the problem parameters a but \"what if the entire input won't fit into memory/on a single machine\". This pattern was typical throughout the day. Two of the remaining interviews were typical algorithms questions such as those seen in Cracking the Coding Interview. The last was a distributed systems design problem with no programming. I had to design a system from scratch, focusing on scalability, reliability, and performance.Once the interview was over I had to wait about a week for the hiring committee to meet. I'm not sure how much this was sped up by already having an offer. They met and gave the thumbs up. This wasn't an offer, but according to the recruiter was almost as good as one. I then met with the managers for three teams that were potential starting teams. These meetings were only 30 minutes so it was tough to decide. I then ranked the teams in order of my preference and sent that to the recruiter. I had to wait for the compensation committee, which was about another week later (6 days I think). I then got the official offer and start project over the phone from my recruiter and via e-mail.They gave me 5 days to respond, although I'm guessing this would have been flexible.

Then, I ended up spending the entire phone interview on one relatively simpleton problem, getting stuck in the nitty gritty details of how to move an index and offset around. It was the kind of question that most programmers could usually do in their sleep, but I was nervous and just jabbered on. The interviewer was nice and polite, but overall I feel the interview style structure is poor and needs to be more varied (how does a blind scientist know that he's touching an elephant if he only feels the toenail?)

There were absolutely no questions about my resume, background, or interest in Google. Coding was done on a whiteboard and they expected code to be compilable, although I was able to use pseudocode for some generic helper functions. All of my interviewer were highly intelligent, polite, kind, and seemed excited to be there. They gave me very useful hints when I ran into issues with my solutions.I did not meet with a recruiter or receive a tour of the campus which would've been nice.

They never called me back then, but my information\u2026\u00a0 was lying around in the system. So now I can confidently say that Google called me back 7 years after I applied, LOL!Anyway, they were pretty happy with my resume/background. The recruiter actually offered to skip the phone interview, and directly call me onsite. Score! We set something up a couple of weeks later. I keep my coding and algorithms skills up to date, since I participate in competitive programming, so I didn't need to prep too much. I think I reviewed mainly the system design portion, because I hate those questions so much!Onsite was a great experience. Funny story, I was waiting in the lobby on the day of my interview. The doors opened, and in walked my co-worker (from my current job at the time)! He did a double take when he saw me, and we both just burst out laughing. Turns out, he was interviewing on the same day, and we didn't know about each other.The interviews themselves were a ton of fun! 4 out of 5 were coding/algorithms, which is my passion. The interviewers are very knowledgeable, and we kicked around many ideas on how to approach various problems. I got through (solved and coded) about 2 problems per interview. Of all the companies I interviewed with (LI, FB, Google) Google's interview was the most thorough in terms of CS areas. They hit all the major CS areas (dynamic programming, recursion, data structures, randomized algorithms, greedy algorithms, systems programming, graph theory, BSTs etc.). I was expecting this, but the thoroughness really surprised me (especially since other top companies only have 2-3 coding modules). On the flip side, they didn't ask a single thing from my resume (even though I was 10 years experienced). That was surprising as well.Luckily both my coworker and I made it through. I will be moving there next week.My advice for Google interviews is to make sure your algorithms/DS are solid. In addition, coding should be second nature. Once you solve the problem algorithmically, writing code on the whiteboard should be completely mechanical. I think most people that interview there are smart enough to make it through, but many fail due to lack of preparation/practice.",

Algorythms, data structures, runtimes, etc. You code in a Google Doc and they dont allow you to run or test your code, so you have to be pretty confident about writing the problem out correctly top to bottom.They didn't care at all about my practical (real world) software development experience, and instead only focused on academic CS fundamentals, as listed above.

        "details": "I was contacted by a recruiter in May for full time opportunities. I had interviewed before for an internship and January but I did not get an offer. The recruiter told me that she found my resume in their database. Since I wasn't prepared to interview at that time, I asked my recruiter if I can give my phone interview in July. The recruiter agreed and asked me to remind\u2026\u00a0 her in June.I reminded the recruiter in June and I was scheduled for a phone interview in July. The recruiter gave me lots of topics to prepare. They mostly covered all the basics of Computer Science I studied in my undergraduate and graduate school. The phone interview took place using a shared Google Doc. I was asked 2 pretty simple questions which I coded and tested within 30 mins. However, there was a huge communication gap between me and my interviewer. The interviewer was not a native English speaker and was not able to understand my explanations. I was pretty disappointed as I thought that I messed it up even though it was no fault of mine. (Note: This was the only negative experience throughout my process and it was completely overshadowed by the positive experiences later). The recruiter called me the following day and told that they wanted me to have a second phone interview as the first interview was inconclusive.I scheduled the second interview a week after. This interview was also on a shared Google Doc and my interviewer told me that the interview will be in two parts, one about CS fundamentals and the second would be some coding. For the first part we did not use the Google Doc and I was asked many questions about Data Structures, Algorithms and Complexity Analysis. The questions will seem very easy if you are well prepared. The coding question was also pretty simple. Two days later I was told that I have cleared the round and they want to schedule my on site interview at Mountain View.I scheduled my interview a month later and the recruiter gave me a lot of material and links to refer for my preparation. The recruiter was extremely helpful and she even wished me luck a day before my onsite. The onsite consisted of 4 technical interviews and a lunch with an engineer. The lunch was not evaluative. All the 4 interviews were white board coding and they tested my coding, algorithm and basic computer science skills. The interviewers were extremely nice. At the end of the day, I was feeling very happy with the level of discussions I was able to have with the interviewers.My recruiter called me about an hour after my last interview to inform that she had already received a couple of interview reviews and they look pretty positive. 3 days later, my recruiter told me that she received all the interview reviews and the comments were very positive and that she would be sending my package to the hiring committee. I heard back from my recruiter about a week later that the hiring committee has approved my application and it will now go for compensation and executive review. A week from there, my recruiter scheduled a Hangout call with me where she explained my offer. :)Even though the entire process was spread over months, it was a really pleasant experience. My recruiter was exceptional and she replied very promptly to all my emails and kept updating me regularly at every step of the process. Now I am looking forward to join Google the coming year once I graduate.",

        "details": "I was contacted by a Google recruiter based on an internal referral from an ex-colleague. Since I already lived in the Bay Area and (apparently) my referrer did a great job talking me up, I was allowed to skip the phone screen stage and proceed directly to the on-site interviews.I went through 5 interviews (45 minutes each) on site, divided as follows: 3 on coding and algorithms, 1 on object-oriented\u2026\u00a0 design, and 1 on high-level system design. I also had lunch (1 hour) with an engineer, where I got to sample their famous free food and talk informally about life at Google.Like many other folks, I came in expecting very difficult and brain-warping questions. But to my pleasant surprise, none of the questions were particularly hard at all. The whiteboard coding and object-oriented design problems were really straightforward, very similar to the types of questions you'll get asked at most other major Silicon Valley tech firms. The system design question was a bit trickier, but it was ultimately just an open-ended discussion which felt pretty similar to real-life engineering design discussions that I do frequently at work.I definitely got the feeling that they don't care so much whether you \"solve\" the problem per se, but rather they focus more about how you analyze and approach the problem and how effectively you engage the interviewer in communicating your ideas. Personally, I really enjoyed all my interactions, and felt very engaged and energetic throughout the entire on-site interview day.After the on-site interviews, I received a call the next day from my recruiter, who told me that the feedback looked good and that I would be moved to the hiring committee stage. Within another three days, I was told the good news that I'd cleared the hiring committee (supposedly with flying colors, although perhaps the recruiter was just trying to flatter me!). They then checked my references and asked for details about my current compensation and competing offers. Finally, it took another week after that to do the team matching and receive the formal offer.",

Also, one of the coding interviews involved a few knowledge-based questions on Java (which I'd told my\u2026\u00a0 recruiter was my most familiar programming language--so they do seem to do some verification of your claimed expertise). \u00a0"

You wait about a week for your recruiter to call you with the feedback given by interviewer. If you passed then you will be offered to visit Google HQ for on-site technical interviews. These on-site will last nearly a full work-day. After this you wait some more for their decision.",

Then he copy-pasted a problem into Google Docs and asked for a solution. So yes, no introductions about himself or about me. I guess they don't care until you go onsite as a \"potential\" candidate. I asked a couple of questions to make sure I understood the problem. Afterwards, I wrote a recursive DFS solution. The interviewer said my solution was fine and that he had no more problems for me. I asked him some questions about the job role, but all I got was vague/cryptic answers. Very weird?Overall, the experience is negative/neutral. My recruiter was AWESOME! (Keep in mind that Google recruiters are different from those who schedule your interview.) Very nice and well spoken. She also articulated to the best of her abilities the role I was applying for without getting into a lot of the details because of confidentiality. Unfortunately, my phone interviewer was a dud. I guess interviewing with Google matters much about the coding skills you have as well as the luck of the draw on who interviews you.Good Luck!",

        "details": "This is the experience of someone who lives 2000 miles away from Google's Mountain View campus. I applied online and heard back in less than a week. The HR phone interview went well so I got a technical phone interview.They gave me a study sheet that lists everything you might need to know for the technical portion of the interview, which is loads of computer science theory, algorithms and data\u2026\u00a0 structures and such. I highly suggest studying this! It is the kind of stuff that you don't normally know offhand but you can brush up on it pretty easily if you knew it at one point. If you have to learn these things fresh then you've got to do it, but I don't think you'll be successful in the interview because it's got to come like second nature. I had plenty of time between the HR phone interview and the technical phone interview, so I spent that time diligently reviewing the things I should know. They are not out to trick you, they sincerely want you to be well prepared for the interview because even great candidates fail simply because they didn't take the time to prepare. The phone interview went well and I felt the interviewer really took time to read my resume and ask thoughtful questions. The questions were not too difficult, and they even gave me 5 minutes to talk about a job that interested them on my resume which was non-technical in nature. If you know how to code and solve simple puzzles you should do fine. I even made some technical mistakes like not being able to find the most efficient solution and I struggled through a question about a hypothetical project management scenario (that question came out of left field, and I stammered and stumbled through the last few minutes giving my answer).3 weeks later they flew me out for 2 nights to the on-site interview. I should mention it wasn't a \"normal\" on-site interview, because apparently it was some kind of major hiring event called a \"batch day\". In terms of the interview itself it was the same as they always do, but what was abnormal was the sheer number of people they had on-site for interviews. I never found out how many there were, but in my building alone there were close to 20 that I saw, and there were loads more candidates walking around campus during lunch time. The on-site consisted of 5 separate 45 minute interviews, each with a different interviewer. I say it was difficult because the questions cover advanced technical subject matter that will be difficult to the majority of engineers. However, if you're the superstar they're looking for the questions will not be that difficult, and may even be fun to solve. I think it's safe to say that if you think any of the questions are difficult and/or you spend the whole 45 minutes writing your solution then you're probably answering the wrong way. They like to test if you know a CS concept by asking generic questions and seeing if you identify the proper data structures or algorithms to use. For example, if your algorithm is wasting time (and whiteboard space) to keep a collection sorted, it could be because you didn't recognize that the full ordering doesn't matter and you should be using a priority queue instead. Those kinds of identifications are major things they're looking for.A week after the on-site I found out the hiring committee approved me. That's when they called my references and a couple weeks later I spoke with various engineering managers who were interested in my skills and background. They didn't care that I had no experience doing what they do, because they knew I was a skilled coder from the interview notes and I'm smart enough to figure it out on the fly. This part is not an interview, just a conversation about interests. They want to find out if you're going to enjoy working on their project, not if you're smart enough or have the right experience - they already vetted that in the on-site interview. In my case I talked with 3 managers who all had different and interesting work, which made it difficult to decide, but ultimately I got to choose which project to join because they all were a great fit.A week after being placed with a team, they wrote up my offer and put it to the VP and senior VP reviews. The waiting is the most stressful thing, because at this point there's practically no reason they're going to reject you, but you have to wait so long for the offer to finally come. Be patient, there is light at the end of the tunnel! After the offer was reviewed by the top execs I got it by e-mail, set my start date and digitally signed it. Now a relocation team is helping me move across the country to start in a month and a half!",

        "details": "I prepared by reading many parts of Skienna\u2019s algorithm design manual, and watching MIT algorithm lectures. I was already good at algorithms considering my previous class performances so I was just brushing up my knowledge. I spent particular attention to Graph theory following the advice of steve-yegge Blog post on the same topic. Solved as many algorithm problems as I could (I would say I spent a total of 30\u2026\u00a0 hours preparing before my interview over one month), especially graphs because I figured graphs were important at google and if I could dazzle them with my ability to do graph problems then I was in.The day started gray to begin with and went downhill from there. The recruiter got there 15 minutes later than our meeting time and meanwhile I went from being mildly nervous to almost hysteric. When we met the first interviewer who was visibly annoyed because of the delay (or maybe that was just my perception), the recruiter blamed me for being late. That\u2019s right. I was so shocked, it took me some seconds to actually figure out he really was saying this and after that I didn\u2019t know what to do to make it right (pathetic, I know).I had five interviews back to back and one additional lunch interview in between. During my first interview it was as if I had a block in place of my brain, I must have asked the poor engineer 10 times to explain the question to me. It was as if he was talking gibberish. I could not focus, I was too nervous and pissed off at the recruiter. Needless to say, I could not write even one single line of code, mainly I stared at the whiteboard. I still don\u2019t remember what the question was actually. I was so embarrassed.No algorithm question was ever asked. Yes, you heard it right. Not even something involving binary tree or search; nothing. There was one design question and three coding question.In short, there were things that were under my control. I didn\u2019t do any whiteboard coding (big mistake) and didn\u2019t have time for mock up interviews (another big mistakes). Given all that happened at the beginning to unhinged me (I am skipping something else that happened on the morning of the interview), had I practiced solving questions on the whiteboard and had I done mock up interviews I should have been able to handle it beautifully.

After such warm-up questions, each interviewer threw me another one which is as difficult as the medium questions\u2026\u00a0 on LeetCode. But they did not expect me to implement them in detail, rather they wanted me to explain the idea so that they can see how I approach to the problem. I was totally lost in one of these problems, and work out the pseudo-code solution on the rest.I just finish the interview and have no idea how it went actually, but I feel it is normal not scary at all.

I didn't take any classes in my program to serve that purpose, therefor I self-educated myself. I bought books, did online classes, and took few CS additional classes at my university. With that said, I had to focus a lot on learning what any CS student\u2026\u00a0 must know, and I did that, but that didn't make me a perfect candidate yet. In my first phone interview, the only one I had, I managed to answer almost all of the questions. However, I found out that I lacked the ability to be a great user of the Java API and abilities when coding solutions. For example, I chose an array as my data structure for the solution, where maybe if I chose a linked list, I would have shown that I'm a stronger programmer.They called me 3 days after my phone interview notifying me that I was not chosen for the second on-site interview. However, the recruiter told me they were impressed by my resume, my analytic skills, and my knowledge in general. He said I need to practice coding more and I will be a great fit. He told me that he'll contact me again at the end of the year and set another interview without me even asking for it. So my advice would be this: Build a very strong knowledge of your preferred programming language. You have to show that you can utilize it the best way possible.",

The question asked was related to summed area tables for 2d matrices of integers. The interviewer did not seem impressed or friendly and immediately hung up after we discussed the single question.The recruiter got back to me one day after the phone interview to let me know that Google wanted me to fly to the Bay Area and interview in person. The travel setup was easy and they paid for flights, hotel, meals, etc.The in-person interview was made up of 4 hour-long interviews with a lunch interview in the middle. It took place in Mountain View on the Google main campus. The interviews were mostly one-on-one and I was asked coding questions on the whiteboard, questions about my resume, and questions that required analysis of existing/provided source code. Some of the topics were parallel execution, algorithms / tree data structures, image processing, and C and C++.About 2 weeks after the in-person interview my recruiter got back to me again to let me know that the team was ready to make an offer.

I was sent an email detailing a long list of potential subjects, which I studied broadly. Instead, I should have been practicing coding problems. The technical interview consisted entirely of two programming questions. I coded on a Google Document along with the interviewer. I could only partially complete both questions. The first question was, \"Given a binary search tree populated with numbers, find the closest match to an incoming number.\" The other question was, \"Given an array of strings, find the common prefix.\"I left the interview knowing I had very little chance of continuing. Despite this, the recruiter called about a week and a half later to decline, but invited me to try again in \"12-15 months\".

Only after you have finished coding in your google doc, you copy and paste your answer into your topcoder practice room system, and use that to test your answer. You should also do this within the time limit, which is not 45 minutes, because the real interview will leave some time for you to ask questions and some chat at the beginning.So it would be appropriate if you could solve the problem within 30 minutes, the problem will not be too hard, but it definitely needs strong preparation.",

        "details": "I got contacted by a Google recruiter sometime in September about a new grad Software Engineering position in Mountain View. Following an initial phone call briefly going over my resume and talking about my interest in Google, the recruiter set up a 45 minute phone coding interview. Unfortunately, no one actually called me as scheduled for my interview, so I contacted my recruiter and she rescheduled. After this interview took\u2026\u00a0 place, I was contacted about a week later saying that they wanted to do a second phone interview before deciding whether or not to bring me onsite for final rounds. I had that set up a couple of weeks later and then heard back again within a week that they wanted to fly me out for onsite interviews. At this point I was also transferred to another recruiter who dealt with onsite interviews and the rest of the recruiting process.I was flown out in early November for a day of four 45 minute whiteboard coding interviews with a lunch break in between the first two and the last two. Overall, it was one of my better onsite interview experiences and the interviewers were receptive to actively participating in the process (not just telling you the problem and then sitting there in silence). I even had one interviewer who took extra time after the interview to go into more detail explaining another way that I could have solved the problem. The engineer I had lunch with was also very nice and helped to paint a good picture of what working at Google would be like.Following this, my recruiter made sure to keep me updated as to how things were going in the review process. I heard back in about a week that my feedback from the interviews would be going through the hiring committee. Then, a few days after that I heard back that I passed the hiring committee and needed to have my package submitted for executive review. About a week after this I got an email from my recruiter saying I had the offer! We discussed the details over the phone and I accepted the offer the following week. All in all, from onsite to getting the offer was a little over 2 weeks.While it was certainly a lengthy process (September - end of November) this wasn't all Google's fault and I appreciated the recruiters keeping me up to date every step of the way.",

        "details": "CONTEXT:I had been contacted by different Google recruiters over the past few years (and had been referred internally but I didnt know about that) and I had kept asking them to contact me later.FIRST CONTACT:I was then again contacted first for an S.R.E position. The recruiter took a mini 5-10 interview about time complexities and some Linux systems questions which they expected people to be well versed in. The recruiter\u2026\u00a0 was a little misleading about what the position was about and made it sound alot closer to S.W.E than it actually is. I did my research spoke with people who interviewed for SRE. I then insisted that I wanted to interview for SWE. The recruiter tried hard to convince me to apply for SRE but my heart was not in it.EVENTUAL CONTACT:After 1-2 conversations with the recruiter, I was then handed over to another recruiter for SWE. I had multiple conversations so that they can ascertain which team should interview me and what should be a good fit. They really do try to set you up for success, I can assure you that much. They were unable to initially be precise about which team I would be a fit for. So they suggested that I atleast do the phone interview (which would be reaosonably generic) and then that would give them some clues.PHONE INTERVIEW STAGE:I gave the phone interview and next day got an email that they want to move forward. I then spoke with a different recruiter who was supposed to handle my case. I again had some clarifying conversations with her about my strengths and interests and made sure that my onsite interview would be something that I expected it to be. This recruiter was fantastic and very detail oriented.I had limited time because I had 2 existing offers whose deadlines were approaching. They scheduled my interview on a day of my choosing.ONSITE INTERVIEW STAGE:The onsite interview went well. The interviewers were friendly and polite. Some young, some slightly older. They were excited to be a part of Google. I had a great time talking and solving questions.The interview questions were not very difficult. I concentrated alot on code organization, cleanliness and correctness. Debugging my code in the interviews and convincing myself and the interviewer of the absolute correctness was very important.If you are comfortable with recursion, Dynamic programming, Arrays, Trees etc that should be fine. I dont think they really wanted to test knowledge of advanced concepts. They concentrated more on basic fundamentals, good solutions, clean & correct code.There were 5 technical interviews and 1 lunch interview. The lunch interview was not technical. It was me who was asking the constant questions in that time.POST INTERVIEW STAGE:Since I was on a tight timeline, things moved at LIGHTNING SPEED. I couldnt imagine that it was possible for this to be done so soon.On the SAME DAY of my interview, I got a positive response and my packet for the Hiring Committee was being prepared. They checked out my references the NEXT day and by nightfall the next day, I knew I was approved by the hiring commitee.OFFER PHASE:The verbal offer was given 2 days later. 2 days of negotiation. I was given the final written letter basically within a week of my interview which I signed.Over all:The recruiter was diligent and FAST. I couldnt keep up, it was that quick. I was very lucky I would say to work with the right people. I made sure i myself was prompt at every stage.",

Set up a phone interview with the recruiter.The call lasted about 15 mins and we discussed my background, interests, and the Google interview process.Next, the recruiter forwarded my preferred technical interview times to a recruiting coordinator to set up a technical interview.Technical interview started with the interviewer briefly discussing what they do for Google, and asked a couple of questions\u2026\u00a0 about projects on my resume. Then jumped into the technical questions.Won't give the exact questions, but instead a general idea of what was asked.First question involved returning true or false for some condition regarding 2 input intervals. Could be approached in a simple one line return statement (by approaching as when is the input going to return false), or a less optimal solution of finding all of the cases where true is returned. Was not thinking and took the less optimal route. Realized that wasn't the best way after the interview.2nd question was basically an expansion of question one. Given two inputs, a list of intervals and another interval. Function from part 1 can be used to do something with the list of intervals. Ran out of time to code if for the final edge case to be completely functional, but told interviewer what had to be done to make it work for all cases.The questions were not really difficult or unexpected, but making silly mistakes lead to a less optimal/not entirely functional solution.Recruiter called back within the specified timeframe with very very general feedback from the interviewer. Nothing specifically saying what went well (or not well). Recruiter told me that at the time they would not be continuing with my application.",

        "details": "After a career fair at my school I talked to the Google recruiter, who suggested I apply online within the next few days to be eligible for an on-campus interview in a few weeks. A recruiter contacted me 10 days later for a technical phone screen--seems I didn't make the on-campus interview. I arranged a for a phone interview, to take place in 5 days' time.The phone interview stretched on\u2026\u00a0 for >45 minutes. Connection wasn't very good. I was asked about experience, general knowledge, and two coding problems, one easier, one harder. On the easier problem I had to re-imagine the algorithm twice to get a time complexity the interviewer was satisfied with. On the second problem I got stuck for a few minutes on an off-by-one error.Recruiter called me later offering an onsite interview. I asked to be interviewed for the Seattle/Kirkland office so she transferred me to a different recruiter who handles that location. I scheduled the onsite as soon as I could (in about 2 weeks' time) because I had a deadline for another offer. Both recruiters were understanding and gave me prompt responses.The onsite was four technical interviews, each an hour long, with an hour-long lunch break in between. All five interviewers asked if I had questions, so by the end of the day I was grasping at straws for any new questions to ask.Each technical interview had two whiteboard coding questions of about equal difficulty. (On interviewer asked three coding questions, but the first was just a warm-up.) On two interviews I answered all questions before time ran out. On one interview, the interviewer made me realize the function I had just coded up wouldn't solve the problem, right as time ran out. I held him back for a few seconds as I drew out the correct solution on the board for him. On the last interview, the time ran out before I could code up the answer to the problem. It was all data structures and algorithms with no architecture questions, but that's probably because I was a new grad.One interviewer was friendly and enthusiastic. Two of them were pretty withdrawn, so I had no idea whether they liked what I was doing or not. The last one was blunt and quick to tell me when I was doing something wrong, but he also never brushed off my questions or weird algorithm ideas. Two weeks after the onsite interview, I got an offer for after graduation.I feel like coding interviews are just as much psychological as they are technical. You have to keep a cool head during a stressful situation and accept criticism with good grace. You also have to be able to communicate your ideas really quickly and effectively. I drew out diagrams on the whiteboard as I was brainstorming--having visual aids really helps.",

I talked with the recruiter very briefly over the phone. He described the role and asked me if it was something I would be interested in, seemed like a very heavy software coding role. I said it was, and then he asked for me to send\u2026\u00a0 an updated resume and he would setup the phone interview.Phone interview was setup for a week away.Interviewer called on a very poor phone line, and was probably on speaker phone. Luckily we moved to the google doc that was setup for the interview and when I could not understand the interviewer he would type the info on the doc.The interview was pretty straight forward.The interviewer asked three questions, two dealing with arrays, and one dealing with a linked list. I struggled a bit through the first question. I worked through it, and the recruiter asked the typical solution time complexity questions, and how can you make it faster, etc.Question 2 I struggled for about 5 minutes to come up with a solution. I was explaining to the interviewer my thought process as I was trying to come up with a way to solve the problem, but that just confused him and he asked if I would just code it, but I wasn't coding it because I had no ideas yet on how to solve the problem. :) After about another minute I came up with a solution. I started coding it and once the interviewer saw that once I had come up with a solution and was able to code it without a hitch he asked me to move onto another question. This was the linked list question, and I knew a solution right away and coded it without any issues.Somewhere in there he asked me \"Do you have experience designing backend databases?\" This is more of a question I would expect for a DBA role, not a typical Software engineer interview question. Anyway I answered him, and that was pretty much the end of the interview. He asked me if I had any questions and I did, and he gave a good answer back...This was my second interview with Google. The first one was a disaster, so I was pretty pleased with the outcome of this interview. I struggled a bit, but was able to answer the questions.Two weeks later I emailed the recruiter and asked if he had heard any results from the interview. He set up a time to talk and when he called he told me that I had done well in the interview but that they found another candidate better suited for the position.Overall a pretty good experience.",

I was contacted by a recruiter within 3 days (including the weekend) and set up an interview for 2 weeks from that date. It was two back to back technical phone interviews. The interviewers let you choose what language you wish to demonstrate your knowledge in. I chose Java for both.My\u2026\u00a0 first interviewer was great. He introduced himself and throughout the interview, was very proactive on trying to guide me through a difficult part of the problem or hinted if he wanted more to the solution. I had to constantly verbalize my thought process, as it was a phone interview, so he mainly responded to that.My second interviewer was not so great. He was 10 minutes late and seemed like he didn't want to help at all. Even after his \"explanation\" of the problem, including a confusion-inducing analogy, I was still a bit uncertain about the problem, so I just went with what I thought was right. It ended up being mostly correct until he literally started to yell at me over the phone for the last line, which was parsing an object to an int, then back to an object when there was another method that did what I was trying to do already (which he didn't explain, so I didn't know what it was, go figure). He seemed to not be paying attention at all, as there were multiple times where I asked a question, only to be answered with silence.After that, I received a follow up email from the recruiter, stating I would know the results in a week or so. I ended up not getting the position (most likely due to that second interviewer), but am not deterred from applying again. I will admit my Java was definitely not up to par, considering that wasn't the dominant language I programmed in for the past half year and only really \"studied\" for two weeks before the interview.",

He asks when we can talk over the phone about \"matching me up with the right opportunities at Google.\" I send a timestamp back.Day 2 \u2014 Phone call with R1,\u2026\u00a0 about ten minutes. He asks to tell him about myself, what my background is, what I'm interested in, why I want to work for Google, etc. He ends by telling me we'll set up a phone interview, which I intentionally schedule for a couple weeks later. (R1 asks me to choose a programming language for the interview, and mentions that he'll be sending me a syllabus to prepare.) Recruiting Coordinator 1 (RC1) emails me the details of the phone interview, which we confirm.Day 9 \u2014 Still no syllabus. I email R1. He sends me a verbatim excerpt from the Steve Yegge blog post you've already read.Day 15 \u2014 Phone interview day. 25 minutes into the schedule time slot, no call. I email RC1. Auto-reply: that account no longer exists. Great. I wait a bit longer. I give R1 a call; no answer, leave a voicemail. He replies within the hour, says he's sorry, asks for availability to reschedule. I reply.Day 23 \u2014 Phone interview finally rescheduled for day 28, by new Recruiting Coordinator (RC2).Day 28 \u2014 Phone interview, take two. Interviewer (a Software Engineer) asks me a little about myself, then moves on to the questions (I won't go into details, due to the NDA). About twenty minutes of basic Q&A about my language of choice (nothing remotely advanced). Then he asks me to describe (just out loud) the 'find' method of a common data structure. Then he modifies the problem definition slightly, and asks me how I would change the 'find' method. This seems fairly straightforward to me. He asks me to implement it in Java in a shared Google Doc. I do. I step through it with some examples. That's about it. I hang up: I think I nailed it.Day 36 \u2014 I email RC2 to check for any feedback. She defers to R1, who within minutes invites me on site to interview. I send my availabilities. I receive confirmation of my interview from RC2. I confirm, and send back two filled out forms (application + NDA; travel form).Day 37 \u2014 I make my travel arrangements through their travel agency. They pay for my flight, lodging for the night before and night after, rental car for the duration, transportation to the airport, and food for the duration. (I easily add two more days at my own expense.)Day 37 \u2014 R1 emails me to tell me he's leaving Google. R1 introduces R2 (not an engineer, this one).Day 38 \u2014 R2 emails introductions and asks when we can talk by phone.Day 42 \u2014 Introductory email from RC3, with two documents which are, again, verbatim excerpts of Steve Yegge's famous blog article.Day 43 \u2014 Phone call with R2, describes the on-site interview; nothing I didn't already know, except (fairly useless) one-line bios of my four interviewers. Eventually I start wondering why I'm seeing and hearing \"Google/YouTube\" when it used to be \"Google,\" so I ask. I find out I'm apparently applying for YouTube now and no one bothered to tell me. R2 also tells me she won't be able to make it to greet me on the day of my interviews, so R3 (also not an engineer) will be replacing her.Day 54 \u2014 On-site interviews. I show up to the wrong lobby, having assumed there was only one. (Pro-tip: check your email from the Recruiting Coordinator for the exact building and address.) Luckily, I was early enough to make it to the right building on time. Interview, interview, lunch, interview, interview. No breaks at all between interviews. Interviewers either give you a blank expression with no feedback as you talk or else hold your hand all the way to the solution. No middle ground. Half the interviewers didn't seem to want to be there. Thought I did kind of okayish in three, badly in one. Very hard to tell over all, but I was pretty sure I wasn't getting an offer.Day 57 \u2014 Within three minutes of each other, emails from both R2 and R3, asking to talk over the phone. I sort out the disorganization, get a call from R3, and am informed I will not be moving on. The only feedback I can get is that my \"coding\" is lacking, which doesn't make much sense to me.Day 58 \u2014 On to other companies.(Day 73 \u2014 Still no reimbursement of expenses...)",

The first phone screen was with the recruiter and seemed to be directed towards \"placement\" in the company. Questions involved things like \"Do you like front end or back end coding more?\", \"What is the time complexity of QuickSort?\", \"How would you estimate some large exponential function?\". There were 0 questions regarding experience or resume information.The\u2026\u00a0 second phone screen was with a technical interviewer within the company. The phone connection was awful, the speakerphone on Google's end increased the awfulness, the poor English of the interviewer increased the awfulness even more, and the lack of respect and attentiveness of the interviewer was the icing on the awful cake.The interviewer was not interested in any discussion of my experience or resume at all. He began by asking an esoteric math related programming problem. I frequently asked questions of the interviewer and was met with no response. At some point, I thought the phone dropped out because of 2 minutes of silence even after I asked multiple times if the interviewer was still there. Eventually, the interviewer said he had to leave to use the bathroom while I was struggling and asking questions. He didn't return for 15 minutes. After my time was up, the interviewer said \"OK, time is up, good bye\" and hung up on me. This isn't how a company as large as Google should be conducting interviews.After notifying the recruiter of the poor interview, she set me up with a third phone screen. The third phone screen had a much more attentive and polite interviewer. Again, no questions regarding experience or resume information were asked. We began immediately by working in a Google Docs window about solving a path finding problem. Google Docs is really bad with code formatting and syntax highlighting, so it was a bit of a nightmare to type out a solution. I left this interview feeling a little better.The final part of the process was to schedule onsite interviews in Mountain View, CA. I was bounced between 2-3 different recruiters and a third party travel agency, so coordinating the travel was frustrating. I'm surprised my application wasn't lost during all the transfers. The onsite process was similar to other tech companies in the sense that there was a long, full day of interviews. In total, there were 6 interviews across a 7 hour period with a lunch interview shoved in there somewhere. Many of the interviewers seemed to be bored or not interested in conducting interviews, so it was a similar experience as my second phone screen. I get the feeling that Google forces their engineers to perform interviews but doesn't hold them accountable to the quality of their interview process. In addition, many interviewers spoke poor English and couldn't successfully communicate the problem that I was required to solve. And finally, I was never asked experience or resume related questions. Google simply doesn't seem to care about experience.In the end, I was contacted with the standard \"We are not moving forward with your application\" with no feedback that would allow me to improve.",

He asked me the same question as the 1st interviewer, and I said I had already been asked that question. He then asked a different question that I did not fully understand which direction he wanted to go and in the end it was an SQL command question. I made a mistake in the third question he asked: I started coding before I had fully considered the entire question.The 4th interview was a presentation of my work.

        "details": "Recruiter contacted me via email or linkedin, can't remember exactly. Asking if I would be interested in Google. I have a long resume and somewhat specialized set of skills in embedded systems so I said ok I will give it a go, but that I am not quite sure how my skills would be useful at Google. They waived the phone screen and moved me directly to an onsite interview.\u2026\u00a0 They send you a list of things to go over to prepare for the interview that looks like something out of college computer science course. I was really busy at my current job so I had little time to go over it, but it was fun revisiting the basic algorithms and data structures.Onsite was 3x45 miutes 1on1 interviews, lunch and 2 more 45 mins sessions. All back to back, no breaks other than lunch.1st session: Interviewer introduced himself gave me time to introduce myself for the 1st 10 mins. Then asked 2 questions. 1st was arrays didnt require to writ code, 2nd was dynamic programming asked to wrote code. I did well on both so we had 10 more mins to spare where I asked him questions.2nd session: Introduction took a really long time, interviewer talked at great length about himself and his work. Asked me if I am interviewing for real or just there to get some interview experience, because apparently thats what he did initially himself. When we got to the question there was only about 15 mins left. Tree related question, that in my opinion wasn't really presented very well. Code was required. I started solving it but he was basically walking me through every step. Not sure if he just wanted to pass me or realized that he already spent too much time talking. Got the correct solution, but I felt like I was being lead to it.3rd session: Embedded systems engineer, asked me a lot about my actual resume. In the end asked me a pretty basic question embedded system specific, asked to write code. Was really easy for me, did really well. Probably the most enjoyable session.Lunch: The weirdest part of the day. Interviewer only got notified the night before, didnt look like wanted to be there. Didn't even know where the closest cafeteria was. Ended up walking for about 15 mins around the campus. Dropped the tray when getting food and spilled lunch over clothes, got really upset. Then suggested we sit outside because its quieter there. But the day was hot and it was really uncomfortable, I was glad to get back inside.4th session: Usual introductions. General distributed systems question. Went pretty well in my opinion, but then I am not a distributed systems specialist, so cant really judge.5th session: The worst one ofthe day. Usual introductions. 2 Questions. 1st question supposed to be a warmup, really simple bit manipulation, but for some reason my brain just went into a feeze, not sure if it was the stress or the sun from the lunch. Anyway I worked manually through some samples and did come up with an algorithm and a correct solution. In fact the interviewer corrected something in my solution, but when I started running it through a test case it turned out my initial code was in fact correct, so we reverted it. Because 1st question took so much time, we only had about 10 mins for the 2nd one which was supposed to be the main question. So we didn't really finish it.Recruiter called me a week later saying that they decided not to go forward with my candidacy at this time. I am not really too bothered since I am pretty happy at my current job and this was more of a learning experience, but I admit that if they did make me a good offer, I would've seriously considered it.While driving home I did come up with a really good solution to that unfinished question from the 5th session. And then also found every single question that I got asked in my interview on programming websites. So looks like if I wasn't so busy and just spent more time preparing, the interview would've gone much smoother. I thought just experience would be enough to pull me through.Other than the lunch person and the 2nd session interviewer, everybody else was very pleasant and enjoyable to talk to.",

I was happy with my job that I held with the same company since college graduation (10 years). However, I decided to give Google a shot. If anything it would probably teach me something about myself.The recruiter set up a phone interview for roughly 1 month later. I apparently did\u2026\u00a0 well as the recruiter contacted me about 2 hours after the interview to say I passed. I was forwarded off to a recruiter in Mountain View that set up an on-site interview for about 1.5 months later. I'm sure the time frames here could have been quicker, but for each step I wanted time to study.During the on-site interview, I met with 5 different engineers (4 where feedback was taken and 1 lunch interview). Each interview lasted between 45 minutes and 1 hour. I interviewed with members from 2 specific teams, the potential ones I would be joining if offered a position. Despite the fact the lunch interview was not supposed to count, I was told that the lunch interviewer was instrumental in getting me hired.It took quite a long time after the on-site interview until I received an offer. It took 2 weeks to collect interview feedback and 1 week to get the go-ahead to put me through the hiring committee. It took 2 weeks to go through the hiring committee and an additional week to go through the executive committee. At that point I had an offer, but it took another day or two to negotiate the details. I initially wanted to decline the offer since I was leery of moving my family, but the recruiter gave me the weekend to think about it.I verbally accepted after the weekend. It took another two days to choose a relocation package and 1 more day to receive a formal offer letter which I electronically signed.I hope I made the right choice! I am worried that I took a step or two down in responsibility, but the compensation was a little bit better than what I was making even cost-of-living adjusted.

The interviewer is there to help you and you need to talk to him even to fully understand the question being asked.

I spent about three weeks studying for the interview, and didn't have any surprises when I finally got there.Google is very good about arranging transportation for the interviews. They covered all costs for me to fly to NYC and spend one night before my interview. Google paid for airfare and hotel directly, and reimbursement for meals and public transit was quick and easy.After the in-person interviews, there were two stages of hiring committees. (I heard about this from my recruiter, but didn't have any contact with the committees beyond my on-site interviews.) During this time, I had phone interviews with several team leaders, trying to figure out where I would best fit. Part of this process was for the Google managers to decide if they wanted me, but it was at least as much for my benefit -- after several of these phone interviews, I picked the team which seemed to be the best fit for me.Everyone was very friendly, and the entire interview process was smooth and enjoyable.",

There was basically zero commentary while I was coding, and nothing to say about my \"thinking out loud\".I completed the question, perhaps it took a bit longer than it should have, but it's an interview....nerves are gonna play a part. Anyway, I was definitely being scored on a timer. There is little doubt about that in my mind. If I wasn't given a timed score, then I lost points for there not being enough time to get around to other questions.He did go through it line by line, and I fixed all the little mistakes (which of course never would have happened in an IDE) and wound up with some decent code. It wasn't the best thing in the world, but it was fast and it worked.After the weekend I was told they would be going with some more experienced candidates.

        "details": "My resume was referred by a current employee. I got a call from a recruiter a couple weeks later and had a 10 minute conversation with her about the whole process, bit on my background, and what I'm looking for. She sent me an email with all of the content that is considered fair game for an interview. I asked for a month to study before the phone interview.The phone\u2026\u00a0 interview was 45 minutes, with maybe 35 of it being technical questions and coding in a Google Doc. The recruiter called me later that day saying they wanted to bring me in for on-site interviews. I asked for them to be scheduled as soon as possible (already been studying, didn't want to forget anything). The on-site interviews were scheduled for almost 3 weeks later.My round of interviews on-site wasn't as smooth as the recruiter claims they usually are. I was taken to a small conference that was to be my \"home\" for the day and the recruiter wrote the schedule of who and when on the white board. The first guy that showed up was not the one listed. Second guy was 15 minutes late. Last guy of the day turned out to be working at home and they had to substitute on the fly (15 minute delay again). Not really a big deal, but I think worth noting.The interviews themselves were 45 minutes each, again about 35 - 40 minutes of which were technical questions and coding on the white board. All questions fell within the review content suggested by the email. One interview was more of a design/approach interview and np-complete did come up once. In general the questions were designed to be challenging, but solvable in the time-frame.To study, I read Wikipedia pages and took notes for the topics mentioned in the email. I used a couple other materials for design and integration patterns. This worked as sufficient review for me.My final comment is regarding how I think they determine level. I was out of undergrad for four years when I interviewed. My experience in the field is longer than that. The recruiter said for their purposes my level was \"four years\", which I think worked in my favor because they expected less.",

        "details": "One in person interviewer openly told me that he hates his job and that he would not recommend anyone work at Google...when he first walked into the room! He didn't even say hello, it was just the first thing he said! Overall after speaking with 6+ people only 2 introduced themselves or told me what teams they work on.My phone interviewer called 1.5 hours early and apologized for being 30\u2026\u00a0 minutes late. He told me either get to a computer or the interview is off. He never introduced himself, he hung up during the call for 10 minutes while I coded and called back after I was done. He looked at my answer, asked a few questions for 10 minutes, and then just hung up without a goodbye- I never even got his name! Apparently he was happy with my answer though because I got a call back from a recruiter only 20 minutes later.My onsite timing was very poor. My first interviewer went on for over 1.5 hours The next interviewer was upset that he had to wait outside for over 45 minutes and not only didn't introduce himself, but was also happy to take his frustration out during the interview. He took his interview over in time, leaving me only 15 minutes until the cafeterias closed for lunch. Therefore we went to a smaller cafeteria which had nothing to drink but water. This would have been fine except after rushing through a meal and desperately needing caffeine (and bathroom) I was not in great shape for the next interview. The first 15 minutes were fine as I wrote 6 different tree algorithms for pre, post, and in order traversals in both iterative and recursive forms. The interviewer then asked me if I likes sudoku to which I replied that I didn't actually know the rules of how it worked. At that point he immediately ended the interview saying he wouldn't have time to explain it before asking his interview question. I was surprised that he didn't want to explain his interview question, but more surprised that he didn't have a backup question either. Since we were over an hour over schedule anyway the next person was already at the door and this is likely why he ended after only 15 minutes. I never got his name, team, or had an opportunity to ask a single question- which was also true for the next interviewer. He asked me a classical question that is common in universities. I already knew some of the possible answers and was upfront with him about this. He responded by taking the white board markers and saying he would like to discuss possible answers instead of coding them. After an hour of good discussion we had not written any code at all and he ended his interview. I assume that for the committee this probably did not reflect well since they like to see code. My system design question was interesting and went on for over 3 hours. The interviewer asked me \"As a team lead- what do you do when an [expletive] pm is trying to make your team death march, saying he will just replace employees as they burn out.\" Having been through similar situations at Microsoft I was very good about handling this sort of thing in a way that is beneficial for all parties involved. I have to say that I was (and am still) surprised by the question though! By the end of my last interview the recruiter had left so I didn't say good bye to anyone. I was just escorted out.",

He just wanted to\u2026\u00a0 follow up. Said that he never received the resume, and hoped I would get back in touch. So I told him about my situation, and he mentioned that they had an LA office. This was news to me, and much closer to home. So I sent in my resume, and he connected me to a recruiter who was closer to me.All in all, I talked with about 4 different people in recruiting. All of them were incredibly nice and helpful. My first \"interview\" was with the second recruiter. It was really just getting to know me, what my interests were, and trying to get a feel for my fit with the company.After that interview, we scheduled a technical phone interview. Gave me to weeks to study up. Lots of review material was sent my way, which was awesome. Ended up reading my algorithms text book again, it was quite a nice read, but I don't believe I would have done poorly on the phone interview, even had I not read it. The tips/references they sent to me were extremely helpful. They sent me Titles/Authors of some amazing books, I recommend reading them even if you aren't interviewing with Google.After passing the phone interview, we had an on-site scheduled about a week later. This was much harder than the phone interview. I get the idea that the phone was just to weed out the weaker candidates. The on-site consisted of 5 one-on-one interviews, plus one lunch \"interview\" where I was able to ask all of my questions. All of them were about 45 minutes each.Every interviewer I talked to was very interesting, and we always had something in common to talk about. The questions were all very interesting problems. There was one point in one of the questions where one of the interviewers put a star next to a line I wrote to remind him to go back and follow up on a comment I made that sounded interesting. I enjoyed the interviews, because it felt like I was back in college, talking to my peers about fascinating problems.There were one or two interviews that I feel I didn't do so hot on.

        "details": "Applied for Google Software Engineer position online. Recruiter contacted me within a week to set-up a phone interview. The phone screen was scheduled within week. The interviewer asked about various data structures and general computer science concepts. Asked me several questions about queues, and heaps. After that two programming questions: 1) traverse array in a spiral order. 2) check if directed graph contains a cycle. in 2 weeks I was\u2026\u00a0 contacted to set up on-site interview. I asked to schedule interview 3 weeks later, so I could prepare for it.There were 4 technical interviews onsite, one lunch interview (just informal talk with some guy from Google glass department), and lastly PhD dissertation discussion.First question was in-order traversal of BST. I wrote the code. Then asked me two check if two different BSTs have same inorder traversal. I suggested to store first inorder traversal into vector, and while traversing second BST check if the element values match. I also started suggesting using linked list, or modified recursive approach, but he said to make life easy and go with the simple solution.Second interviewer gave me array, with elements first strictly increasing, then strictly decreasing. Asked me to find the largest number. I suggested to use binary search. O(logN) time complexity, with no additional space required. After implementing the code he asked another question. Given infinite doubly linked list, and separate list of elements, which are linked to some linked list elements. Find out from the list of elements how many neighboring groups are formed. I suggested to use Hashtable, to make look-up process quick, and traverse the elements and check if they are neighboring elements. O(N) time and space complexity. Implemented the code, and time ran out to test if with different cases.Third interview was the weirdest. The guy had thick accent and from the beginning became apparent communication was an issue. He gave me system design question: Observer class has three methods AddObserver(), RemoveObserver(), NotifyAllObservers(). After asking some clarification questions, I suggested to use doubly linked list to keep track of all observers, and hash table to look-up the individual observer. Then he asked to implement three methods. After implementing the code in JAVA he told me the program would not work. Apparently the Observer was designed for Chrome browser. He went into details when user clicks on mouse and then key-press is released. I responded the initial question was very vague and asked for more clarification and precise requirements. I suggested what I would change to go around the problem, but time ran out and didn't get a chance to modify the code on whiteboard.After that I had lunch and came back for fourth technical interview.Fourth interview: the guy told me to add two numbers in base 3 system. The input: two base 3 streams provided as String. function should return sum of the two numbers also in String format as base 3 stream. I suggested to convert from base 3 into base 10, add numbers and convert back to base 3. I know how to add two (base 2) binary streams without conversion, since I was under the time pressure I went easy way. I implemented conversion from base 3 to base 10. The interviewer said he was satisfied and wanted me to solve another problem. He gave me file size, and asked me to partition file into chunks, so that each chunk size is power of two, and the number of chunks is minimal. I suggested to find the nearest power of two and obtain absolute value of difference between the original file size, and nearest power of two. Then re-apply the process until reminder is power of two (1 is 2^0). There was time pressure, so didn't have time for analysis, just implemented and turned in the code.Last interview was PhD dissertation discussion. It went alright. Most interviews went ok, except the 3rd one, during which I had hard time communicating. Within a week recruiter emailed me saying hiring committee didn't want to move forward with hiring.",

The process was pretty quick and easy -- only a few required forms prior to my phone screening. The phone interview was a simple data structure question requiring ~25 lines of Java code. After the interview, I was then offered to fly to Mountain View for an on-site\u2026\u00a0 interview. This consisted of four 45-minute interviews, plus an hour for lunch. All of them were algorithm/data structure questions (trees, graphs, arrays), so I can't comment on the nature of the design style questions. In two of these interviews, I successfully answered the first question and was asked a second. In one interview I answered the first question and we discussed my resume for the remaining time. The final interview was a bit more tricky, requiring careful handling of edge cases, so I got a bit mixed up and wasn't able to fully complete the problem (I did have a full whiteboard of code by the end of it). I felt good about the interview, but was notified 2.5 weeks later that the hiring committee decided not to continue the process. My recruiter suggested I get more experience, but cited no more reasons beyond that.",

        "details": "I had applied through their job portal online. I was contacted by the first recruiter in January 3rd week. We exchanged emails, she had me fill out a couple of forms, and then I was handed over to another recruiter. She, in turn, handed me over to yet another recruiter.The recruiter coordination was not good, their responses were all over the place. Two recruiters were working in tandem to schedule\u2026\u00a0 my phone interview and they managed to convert the interview time from PST to my local time with an 1hr error. This ended up with me waiting for the phone screen call one hour earlier than it actually was. I had given up and decided that the person would not call and then I receive a call 1 hour later.The interview itself was appallingly conducted. First of all, the interviewer seemed to be in a room with a lot of echo. Second, he must have been using some kind of phone system on speaker or something similar because I could hear my own voice echoed back. I mentioned this to him twice, since it made it difficult to hear his words with the reverberation in the room blurring his voice and my voice echoing.The first time, he said I must be using a headset and that the microphone was too far away from the mouth. I told him that I wasn't using a headset. He waved it away.The second time, he said the same thing. By then I had given up on the interview. I couldn't hear much, he wasn't helping. Trying to decipher the conversation and trying to code simultaneously had become a horrible adventure. Besides, he wasn't listening to half of what I'd said, be it trying to explain my problem-solving method or be it my concern regarding the fact I couldn't hear much over the garble.Some of the start-off questions (break-ice questions) he had asked regarding my resume were pointedly patronizing or so I felt. I understand however that a phone screen doesn't give you enough indicators about these things and I could be wrong.The questions themselves were basic programming, then some threading, concurrency, map-reduce trivia questions.I understand many people have the ambition or life-goal to work for the company. Perhaps to them this process might be forgivable. Most interviews probably aren't like this and I might have had something of an exception. I consider it disrespectful of my time and an unwillingness to listen to what I could potentially provide.",

Most of the interviewers gave one large problem and kept me polishing\u2026\u00a0 the solution until the time ran out. I did not really get a chance to ask a lot of questions about the company (just asked two and answers did not really amuse me).I don't remember the most difficult problem, but two largest ones were: write `Game Of Life' (not in pseudocode, in Java!) and write a procedure that draws a line in a bitmapped array (again, in a real programming language). That had to be done on a whiteboard (side note: while I has writing interviewers were copying my solutions into their notebooks by hand). All problems throughout my interview included questions about complexity and some included questions about optimization and testing.I got a feeling that the work is challenging from technical point of view, but the interview process seems quite ridiculous (especially writing substantially large programs on the board) and most interviewers' attitude can be described as `quite arrogant.' I did not get any background on the company and its nature of work I throughout the interview process and did not feel frustrated when they did not proceed with an offer.P.S.

I feel a better approach would have been to just use them and mention in passing how they work.My third interview was troubleshooting a site deployment problem. I just isolated components and talked specifically about how I would pinpoint and solve problems related to networking, load, etc. We just went through different hypothetical scenarios and how it affects users, etc.I then had a second round of interviews consisting of three more and a lunch on a separate day. Two more coding not entirely different than the previous two. One had much more emphasis on analysis of runtime and different ways to improve and the limits on maximal efficiency.

This recruiter was energetic, interesting and seemed genuinely interested in finding the right spot for me at Google. Unfortunately, I had just started my new job and have a personal policy of staying at a place of work for at least a year. That, and the project was interesting and exciting so I\u2026\u00a0 did not follow up and let him know why.Time passed and eventually he moved on from Google. About a year later another recruiter contacted me. She seemed nice but nowhere near as enthusiastic. We setup a time to talk over a Hangout but unfortunately she cancelled at the last minute. Not good, I'd changed my plans around to fit. So I agreed to her request to setup a new Hangout the next week. Nothing happened. After about two weeks (I waited due to work commitments) I got back in contact with her and we worked out a new time and the interview went ahead. She was courteous and seemed reasonably enthusiastic, but nothing like the previous guy who had a specific position in mind. No, this was now very open ended, non-specific and I started to feel like just another candidate. Despite this I decided to see where it went.So a technical phone interview was setup and it was possible one of the worst phone interviews of my career. I could not hear a thing. The call quality was terrible. This made it extremely hard to hear what I was even supposed to be doing. Fortunately, the Googler on the other end was very helpful, polite and understanding. We eventually nutted out what he wanted me to do via Google Docs.Then I waited over two weeks for feedback. I passed the interview but then I was transferred unceremoniously to recruiter the 3rd. This guy was even less enthusiastic but communication was clear and to the point. He ignored my request to talk to him over Hangout. But, the second interview got organised with a team I was interested in.The second interview however was far worse than the first. Call quality was better but still not great. Worse still however was the interviewer who, seemingly, had zero interest in being there. He explained what he was looking for, a basic problem, and for the rest of the interview ignored most of my questions. I was trying to talk through the problem, explain what I was doing and also try and see how he would work with me. From what I heard I'd expected this from a Google interview. And indeed, the last interviewer was great. However, this guy did not answer my questions - aside from some grunts - and seemed more worried that I wasn't using STL. I told him I just wanted to keep it simple as it was a simple question.Did I forget to mention that he was a full 15 minutes late to the interview? I cannot stand this and it is disrespectful and very tardy. Also, the question asked had nothing to do with the specific position I was interviewing for.In the end, I've no doubt I gave a sub-optimal impression on my second interview. But what do you expect from a sub-optimal interview? Garbage in, garbage out. So in the end I did not get an offer.While I understand that I am perhaps in the minority here as far as Google interviews go I can see from the stats that I am certainly not alone. From my experience I can only conclude that Google does not take its recruitment seriously and it has big issues with process.",

We briefly discussed a phone chat but quickly moved forward with an on site interview. Initially, I was to interview at their New York office but the recruiter felt my chances were better if I interviewed at their headquarters in\u2026\u00a0 Mountain View. So I agreed to a face-to-face interview at their headquarters.At this point, I was introduced to a second recruiter who helped set up my travel arrangements, discussed what to expect, and answered any additional questions I had. She had also given me a list of topics to study and a couple of websites to visit to help prep. She was the one I met with when I went onsite and she let me get a drink and use the bathroom before heading to a conference room where I would spend the next few hours. She then left me after giving me a chance to ask any more last minute questions.I had a schedule of 3 interviewers followed by a lunch break followed by 2 more interviewers to finish the day. The interviewers were nice and accommodating and happy to answer any questions but were very mindful of the time except for my final interviewer who probably spent 2 hours with me. They gave the impression they are passionate about what they're doing and did not dismiss anything I said as foolish or dumb (I mention this as I've read other interview accounts who said their interviewers were snobbish and elitist).After about a week, I emailed my recruiter asking about a status. She said they were still waiting on the feedback from some of the engineers and that she would find out where they were with this. About another week after that she called me to inform me they were not continuing with the process. I had tried to find out more about the reason but she said there was no feedback available and that it's a 'flaw' in their process. She encouraged me to apply again in another year or so indicating that people often did re-apply after their first try.",

        "details": "I applied online and got a response from a recruiter almost immediately. After that everything went very slowly. The entire process has taken 2 months and the worst thing \u2013 communication with my recruiter was almost completely broken: I did not receive responses for several days; the recruiter scheduled phone calls and did not show up, etc. From the very beginning I had the impression that the recruiter is not\u2026\u00a0 very interested in dealing with me. I was treated as a low priority candidate. May be it's because of the lack of internal referrals.I think, I could be a very good match for Google: PhD with strong math background, excellent GPA, 15+ years of continuous coding experience, patents, lots of cool research projects I worked on in the past including projects related to the position I was applying for, Google's culture fit, strong desire to be a part of Google. I did very well during the phone interview and was invited for the onsite part.I think onsite interviews (4) went very well too. What really surprised me is that interviewers asked lots of questions about my experience.Problem solving part was not very challenging. This was a little bit disappointing. Tasks were routine and not very well though-out. Solving a difficult problem you have a chance to shine. When you are dealing with an easy problem it's all just about how fast and accurate you are in white-boarding. I cannot say I was absolutely perfect, but I am sure I did not fail any single part, although sometimes I experienced problem understanding what the interviewer really wanted to see.Interviewers were nice and friendly. I did not have the feeling I was dealing with stars. Several times interviewers were even not up to speed with my ideas and my concern is they might not be able to record everything accurately.I was waiting for the feedback for 3 weeks. By this time I already had an offer from a big Google's competitor, but I was patiently waiting for the \"job of my dream\". I don't know what really happened during these 3 weeks. According to the recruiter, she was collecting interviewer's responses. It strange, since it sounds like my case has not even reached the hiring committee. After 3 weeks the recruiter scheduled a call where she told me they would not move forward with my candidature, because \"I did not walk through problems well enough\".I do not agree with this conclusion, since I got the opposite impression from my interview. My guess \u2013 the reason for the rejection was something else. After all I am extremely disappointed.My recommendation to other candidates: think twice before applying for a position at Google. It takes too long and the result is very unpredictable. They are not just looking for smart/skilled/passionate. Evidently there are some hidden criteria. And don't trust Google's articles and videos about their recruiting process too much. They present their understanding of the perfect recruiting process. The reality is very different.The other advise is try not to spend too much time describing your experience and asking questions. You have only 45 minutes and you will need this time to work on algorithmic problems. I typically had no more than 25-30 minutes left for problem solving and I was usually given 2 tasks. Note that coming up with a right idea and implementing the main functionality is not considered a complete solution. For the record they want to see 100% completed code. If you've run out of time just because the task selected by the interviewer was too large for the timeframe, it's your problem. Interviewer is always right. The phrase \"did not walk through problems well enough\" in my case could easily mean \"proposed the right solution for the second problem, but did not finish writing the code in time\".",

Apparently google is notorious for having low\u2026\u00a0 salaries after searching around online at employee complaints. Google was completely unwilling to negotiate the base salary or match other offers I had in hand (or even really come close in my opinion). The recruiter was a bit \"jerky\" and was trying to pressure me into accepting the offer by implying that every other software company was a poor decision to consider. I felt like Google's unwillingness to negotiate the salary at all hinted at a larger \"big corporate\" problem that would likely be an issue throughout employment there. I ended up accepting a job offer at their direct competitors instead which lacks the \"big corporate\" feel and the HR team was much more pleasant and reasonable in negotiations.",

Some of the interviewers had very\u2026\u00a0 good questions which you can attack from different angles and have a very good discussion, others were quite shallow and pretty much didn't know anything other than a single question they had prepared to ask at the interview. The interview process or questions aren't something out of the ordinary for a tech company. But what I found a little disconcerting is that some interviewers didn't talk about their own job with enthusiasm when I asked them about it at the end of the interview. Also I wanted to find out what area or team I'd be joining if offered a job but I could only get some general answers. Several weeks later the hiring committee finally reviewed my case and decided to not extend an offer. I'm not sure how the committee works. Are they the same people who interviewed me? What do they remember about the interview after several weeks? Strangely I got no negative feedback communicated to me by the recruiter, but no offer either.

Since I was a former intern my phone screen was waived (had two 45-minute screens when applying for internship), and my former intern host was asked to provide\u2026\u00a0 a feedback. I was asked to do a job talk (as a PhD) followed by 4 rounds of interviews, 2 research and 2 engineering.The job talk was 45-minutes followed by 15 minute questions. I was basically talking about what I did during the graduate school years, so it was quite pleasant and I was excited to see people interested in my work. After that it was a casual lunch with my intern host, so I devoted every minute enjoying the food.The two research interviews were conducted by people familiar with the field, and had challenging questions on the overall understanding. I found it very exciting as both of us would get involved into discussion about the state-of-the-art. A little coding and math details were asked, but mainly about research ideas.The two coding interviews were very standard - I did not get those very difficult questions like \"implement sudoku in 30 mins\" that someone allegedly encountered. The interviewer was constantly copying my whiteboard writings down, which created a little down time. I asked the interviewer and s/he said it was recently required and no worries. I guess if this could be disclosed by the recruiter earlier it would be better.After the interviews the recruiter followed up promptly, with accurate estimates of when I would get updates.

We had a 20 minute conversation about my current experience and about what I was looking for in a future job. He then said he would like to set up an interview in the next couple of weeks. He\u2026\u00a0 also requested I send him a copy of my resume.8 days later I got an email from an interview coordinator. The interview was setup for 6 days from when this interview coordinator contacted me.The interview was to be conducted over the phone and use a Google doc. I sent an email back to the interview coordinator asking if I could setup a Google hangout interview instead, since I don't have a headset that attaches to my phone, but I do have a webcam and headset that attach to my computer. (I watched an interview preparation video on the Google jobs page that suggested that I have a headset, and not to use speaker phone). The interview coordinator sent me instructions for the Google hangout interview; these instructions said the interviewer would contact me with the URL for the hangout.I spent the weekend before my interview preparing, I practiced coding every sort and search function, some patterns that I haven't used in a while, etc., as I finished my undergrad 5 years ago, and expected the interview to be quite academic, based on feedback I've read on this site. Also reviewed OO principles, etc. I thought I would be in pretty good shape for the interview.The time for my interview came around, and no email from the interviewer containing the Google hangout link. I figured I would give the interviewer 10 minutes before I took any action. 15 minutes later, still no email. So I emailed my recruiter. I got an email back from him almost immediately saying he would contact the interviewer. I then got an email from the interviewer with the hangout link. I clicked the link and it said I did not have permission to join the hangout. I also noticed the interviewer had not joined the hangout. I then got a call from the interviewer. He said that he hadn't ever used hangout before in an interview and so we should just do the interview over the phone, as that was his preference. I asked him to give me a minute to try to get the audio worked out on my end as his voice was muffled to the point I could barely understand him. Nothing I did fixed this, so I asked him if he was on speaker, he said \"yes\". I asked him if he could go off of speaker because I couldn't hear him. He did and then I could hear him perfectly, but both of us had to hold our phones, which was quite uncomfortable.He continued by saying that he just had one question for me, and that it would probably take me the duration of the interview to complete. He pasted a java function into the Google doc (as I am most familiar with java). He explained briefly what the function was supposed to do, but said there were errors in the code and that it didn't currently accomplish the goal and that he wanted me to identify and fix the errors.I won't specify what the code did, but I will specify that it dealt with a domain I was only vaguely familiar with. I started walking through the code with the interviewer to understand the flow of data through the function. The code was quite simple, and with some help from the interviewer identified the first issue. The issue was an incorrect mathematical function. For example the line of code was supposed to produce f(x) = y, but it was not producing y. The function was not difficult, but I couldn't figure out what the mathematical manipulation of variables should be to produce the desired outcome. The interviewer then went on to say that we had only 15 minutes left in the interview, and that we should move onto to see if we can find more issues. So we stepped through some more code assuming the first issue was working correctly. Then I found the next issue, it was exactly like the previous issue. This time the function was a little simpler, but still not something you could solve in less than 5 minutes. I tried a few different things, talking the interviewer through exactly what I was thinking. Then the interviewer said that our time was up, but that he would give me an extra five minutes to solve the current function, as I was getting pretty close. In the five minutes, I solved that function. He then asked if I had any questions about Google that would be appropriate for an engineer that it was likely the recruiter couldn't answer. I asked two questions and then we ended the call.",

        "details": "Have interviewed in person with Google several times over the years most recently in Nov 2012. Have never gotten an offer. I will honor my agreement w/Google not to reveal specific interview questions, but they tend to be generic computer science-type questions. As someone who is at mid-career it is disappointing to be asked questions that might be more appropriate for an intern applying for their first summer job. I\u2026\u00a0 felt I had a lot to contribute but the interview process doesn't focus on anything besides just basic coding questions.Google contacted me by phone for a conversation with a recruiter. The technical phone screen step was waived and I was invited in for an in person interview a few weeks later. Five technical interviews plus lunch.I felt I did well on the technical questions but the whole atmosphere of the process seemed a bit negative. When I interview I like it to be with people who are clearly inspired by and excited to work for their company. I just didn't get that sense from these people--they had no passion to work for Google. The person who took me to lunch actually made clear to me that he was very unhappy working for Google.A positive interview experience is one where I come away from it inspired to work for the company--and then if I don't get the job, it is a disappointment because I won't be working there. With Google the disappointment is more that I feel I wasted a day of my time there. I ended up thinking that I would use a Google offer--had it been forthcoming--more for leverage in negotiating a slightly sweeter deal with my current employer--where I'm actually mostly happy. When I was thinking in those terms even before hearing Google's negative decision, it seems clear that Google failed in motivating me to want to work for them.Upon reflection, my basic take away was that I didn't really interview for a position at Google. Instead, they conducted a very, very generic tech interview which could just as easily have been an interview for any other tech company, be it another large company or a startup. Absolutely zero information was revealed that would allow me to determine whether this might have been a suitable match for me. Google seems to be counting on their name and reputation to attract good candidates and they seem to feel they don't have to really put anything into the process themselves. It's hard to feel excited about working for a company when their interview process is just a generic imitation of the interview process at many, many other tech companies I've interviewed with in my career.Speaking only for myself, Google's name and reputation will probably always be enough to get me to invest a big chunk of a day with an interview. But Google seems to expect more than that--they seem to expect a significant investment of time in preparing for the interview as well. I'll admit I probably didn't prepare as hard as I might have for this interview and that may have been a factor in the outcome. However, as an experienced professional with limited time, I need a reason to believe that the investment of time in preparation is worthwhile. Google, unfortunately, gave me no reason to be enthusiastic about the process so that I'd put the time in. Again--at least in my case--it will take more than just relying on their good name to get me excited about working for them.",

Second was for designing and coding an algorithm and verbally describe a game design. Second one went\u2026\u00a0 good enough to make me move to the next step.Primary recruiter handed me over to the secondary recruiter. It's clear that the primary recruiters are friendlier and take more time to get to know you better. Secondary recruiter didn't seem very enthusiastic. He setup my interview with with members of the two teams I had narrowed down with the earlier recruiter and referred me to a travel agency to setup the travel for the onsite interview.I was booked for a total of 5 interviews, 3 before lunch and 2 after. Lunch was in Google's cafeteria with another employee separate from the interviewers. Campus has a very nice college feel to it.Interview questions range in difficulty. When they see you are solving questions with ease, they turn it up a notch. I found a very heavy emphasis on graph algorithms in my questions. I was expecting it but not to this level, so better prep for those! esp. graph search algorithms and their variations. Lots of code writing on the whiteboard to the point where you run out of space! Had to design a data structure with certain properties and the interviewer kept asking for new methods. One of the interviewers had a thick accent and it was very hard to understand him. That was the only interview that I felt going bad because of the communication issues.Overall a positive experience. I got to brush up on a lot of things that I had forgotten since college.",

They told me in a week, that I did well on the interview, then they sent all my feedback to a recruiter in London, because I wanted to work in Zurich, and not in America. There were several more things they wanted to know before they could make the final decision: grades in university, current salary and so on.

        "details": "For the reading impatient, in a nutshell: I found the interview process (non-US citizen) extremely long, very tedious, and in a sense dehumanizing (in your phone interviews you get your code questions, write the answers and very little else matters). Overall, the whole ordeal was very life draining, and comparing with peers that were going through it at the same time (as I later learned), very focused on a specific\u2026\u00a0 type of developer/engineer: without exception very experienced people were rejected.Google can hire whom they please, but if they know the profile of the person they want to hire, why bother contacting people with 10+ years of experience only to reject them all later? It's a waste of time for them and the interviewees even more so. One could arguably say that it is disrespectful as well.For those caring for all the details: I was contacted by a recruiter mid 2012, asking if I was interested in discussing a position. I'm not a US citizen, so I was dumbfounded. Of couse I was interested, but why would they contact me then? (I had sent a resume to Google Brasil years prior, with no response).So a month after I responded I finally heard back, and we agreed because of the project I was in and their timelines to start the process in December. Apparently someone had recommended me, and wanted to remain anonymous. So here we had about 5 months worth of time that I took to practice Portuguese again, brush up my resume with competitions, study, and get Android experience.During that time, I started to learn that certain other people in my country had also been contacted, some with a similar set of skills and experience. So clearly there was a larger, coordinated effort going on, not just an interest in myself, this made sense but it also made me more wary of it.December came and I contacted the recruiter once more, and they requested that we start the process in January. So New Years' studying and January came, and finally got a call. I was expecting a technical interview at once, but got another screening (similar to the one the year before) instead. After some email back and forth, a coding interview was scheduled for mid February.The interview itself was a coding problem of some calculations, and I thought I blew it. To my surprise I was contacted again the next week, and another interview set for the beginning of March.That one started by the engineer unable to call my phone, I had to call him international, and explain how to call me. Some 15 minutes were spent there. So finally I got some web system design and scalability questions, that (with guidance mind you) I think I answered successfully. I felt much better after that interview.But weeks rolled by with no response, I was a nervous wreck, so I wrote back asking what the status was (as April was a deadline for H1B), and eventually I got a response that because of the engineer's feedback the process was over for me. I honestly appreciated getting the response, but obviously was not happy.I was taken aback, but what surprised me even more was that engineers that I consider better than myself, were also getting interviews and also didn't get a lot further. The pattern seemed to be people with plenty of experience (10+ years), multiple team positions, and a history of leadership as well. A pattern hard to ignore.In the end, like I said, the experience was very life draining, I would not enter into it again lightly. Consider a hiring process that takes months and months (unnecessarily, ie. 3 months for 2 coding interviews), that is not a good indicator of the health of the hiring workflow.",

I won't list of exact questions due to NDA which I would like to respect, but will outline areas - see (*).Some quick background on myself: new grad with masters in computer science.Although I did not receive an offer in the end, it was a great experience and Google left me with\u2026\u00a0 a very positive impression about them. Albeit, the entire process was overall on the slow side, but my HR contact was very responsive to emails and kept me up-to-date.I applied online on the company website. About a week later, I got an email to schedule two back-to-back phone interviews in < a week. Second one was rescheduled last minute to next week. Both phone interviewers went very smoothly and the interviewers were very polite and easy to speak with. Each were an hour in length, with maybe the first 10-15 minutes of resume questions, background, etc., then it quickly became technical. I coded in a shared Google Doc for both. The first interviewer asked for whatever language (I chose C++), but the second one insisted on Python (which I was happy to oblige, it's actually my favorite to hack in). I had those two on my resume, so I assume they were probing me to see if I was lying. They will not ask you anything not on your resume and conversely, don't lie/exaggerate as if one of the largest tech. companies doesn't encounter that on a daily basis!***** I haven't seen any of the questions they asked here on Glassdoor, but were similar in complexity. 1st phone interview in C++: was asked to design and code a data structure with specific customization to a queue, big-O analysis, optimization, and short discussions on two other problems (no code due to time constraint). 2nd phone interview: manipulating lists in Python, write some SQL queries (simple selects with joins) for a DB schema he pasted into the doc, also answered some high-level conceptual questions on data structures. Made a small error in one of the SQL queries that I quickly corrected, but pretty much got the rest without help. With that said, couldn't answer the last sub-question in each interview, but they both said it was more of a bonus at that point.Within an hour of the second phone interview, got an email saying they were impressed and decided to move on to onsite interview. This is the part that took a while, almost three weeks just to get it finalized, but it did go smoothly.They put me in a nice hotel for two nights which provided breakfast and a shuttle limo (yes, limo) to/from the Googleplex. The office was very nice, the whole dot-com atmosphere still in full swing. Cubicles looked a bit cramped though compared with other places I've seen. Four people sharing one big cube. I've had larger, private cubicles in past internships at other places. Not a big deal though, I guess. Food was fantastic, better than the crap I regularly eat anyways.My big day lasted four hours consisting of 4 one-on-ones each about 45 minutes and a one hour lunch meeting (not evaluated) with a senior who would answer whatever questions I had and gave me a tour of the campus. All interviewers were very nice and helpful and really do try to push you in the right direction - some more than others, naturally. Perhaps one came off as a bit arrogant at times, but still helpful. Another implicitly told me he wasn't into his duties, but ironically was the most fun to speak with.***** I guess here's what most people want: Two interviewers asked resume questions for maybe 5 minutes, but other than that everything was purely technical: writing code on a whiteboard. The questions ranged from binary search trees (recursion), caching, string manipulation and some random recursion (I got an easy one). Usually asked to design test cases at end (no code). They were not very difficult, but it was clear that you really had to know them inside-out. Be sure to constantly talk and explain what you are thinking. Much better than long periods of silence which I had a few times. I couldn't solve a corner (admittedly important) case for the BST question, and my design for the specialized caching question was not too impressive but it did work; other than that, I pretty much solved the rest without hints. Any time left-over is given to you to ask them whatever you'd like.Went to hiring committee, but alas, two weeks later got the disappointing email they were not going to extend me an offer. HR contact encouraged me to reapply after a year of industry experience, which, depending on my situation at that time, I will consider. Google has the advantage that if they are not absolutely certain you'd be a stellar engineer, they will pass even if this means false negatives.",

        "details": "I was contacted by a Google recruiter to first schedule a phone interview.The phone interview was to be held on the phone and through Google docs where both the interviewer and I could type in text on the same page.When talking to the recruiter, she asked me what languages I was the strongest in. I responded that my most recent languages were C and Matlab. She said that the interview\u2026\u00a0 would be in one of these two languages, but that the potential on-site interview could be in anything on my resume. My most recent background is in embedded systems development, but to my complete surprise once the phone interview started, the interviewer asked questions in C++. I did answer the initial basic C++ question correctly, but I was not prepared to answer the C++ questions and I asked the interviewer if she was familiar with my background and if she could switch to C instead. She did.During the interview she asked about software implementation of the cache driver first. We had a detailed discussion about it. Then she asked if I was familiar with binary trees. I said that I have heard of them, but never used them, and explained that I have used linked lists in the past and implemented basic search functions on them. We later discussed differences between arrays and linked lists and I answered all her questions correctly. So, in total, of the questions she did ask, I answered all of them correctly and frankly did not find them very insightful or difficult.A week later, I received the call from the recruiter that I would not have any further interviews. Citing company policy, she declined to provide specifics. She did say that they were looking for people with broad backgrounds.Here is what I think happened.In short, the interviewer's background was completely different from mine. I would not have any issue with that, after all Google is a software company, but that is not how the process was explained to me. I was prepared for a completely different type of interview, based on the comments from the recruiter. Not only did the recruiter set me up for a different type of interview, the interviewer herself was completely not familiar with my background. There seem to be limited communication between the recruiter and the interviewer and little understanding of my qualifications on their behalf.I feel misled, because I should have not been told by the recruiter that the interview would be conducted in C, whereas clearly the interviewer must have had her eyes set on C++. I would have prepared for a C++ interview if it were not for the comments by the recruiter. For sure I would have not asked to switch to C, if I had any inclination that C++ were so important to them. The interviewer should have insisted on conducting the interview in C++, if it were so important. She should have insisted on my answering the binary tree questions, if they were so important.Lessons learned:1. Do not take everything the recruiter tells you as 100% accurate. Google is now a large company and has large company policies, meaning the recruiter may have very limited communication with the interviewer.2. Be prepared for any type of questions, regardless of your own background. It may not be checked.3. Be prepared for specific skill tests, not only for evaluation of your thinking ability. In spite of Google claiming that the interview process is about determining how candidates think, it is apparently not always true. I have IQ over 170. My logic in my answers was 100% accurate, but I did not want to discuss issues I was not prepared for. I do not think the interviewer was interested in my thought process or in my thinking capability. It appears that she was merely interested in me solving academic problems that she knew the answers to.",

A tough, but positive interview experience.The recruitment process is a bit on the slow side, though recruiters always kept me well-informed. I had two phone interviews before being asked to come to Google Los Angeles. The interviews consisted of the standard Google questions that are mentioned elsewhere on this website. I made a fundamental mistake on the first interview, but was able to send\u2026\u00a0 a correction via email. The interviewers really want to help you.Before entering the building, applicants are required to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Even if I were to reveal what questions were asked, it wouldn't help. It's standard Computer Science algorithms and discrete math. You have to know your stuff and be able to explain yourself. Out of the six or so interviews, I totally botched one, becoming stuck. On another, I forgot an important conceptual detail. The rest went very well.I received notification that I was not selected a few weeks later. The recruiters and staff are all very friendly. The engineers' reputation for being really smart is well-earned. The interviews are tough, and if I couldn't get in ---being one of the top students in my CS program--- then it must be true that only the best of the best get in. The Google office is amazing, as is to be expected. I had a very positive impression of Google and their recruitment process. I appreciated being placed in a nice hotel and having all travel expenses paid. It was nice to get a short trip to LA.Anyone who is selected for an on-site interview already has a bright enough future so that she/he can find other offers of employment easily. From this website, it appears that most applicants who come on-site to interview do not get selected. However, anyone may apply again after six months.

Although I was quite nervous about the interviews, but I noticed that having a little chat with the recruiter in the interview room before my interviews started\u2026\u00a0 definitely calmed me down. I started off well and then the momentum carried on and I was able to perform much better because of not being nervous.I was informed early January that I had passed all the hiring committees. After that, it took number of months (about 4.5) for them to find a matching team for me. I think this is the most painful part in the whole process, because you are in kind of limbo if a match has not been found yet. While passing the technical interviews is a reason to celebrate, it soon becomes clear that you have to wait until a team is found, which can vary on case by case basis.Finally, they found a match for me and I talked to the manager over the phone. He explained all the details about the kind of work being done in the team. I got super-excited by the details of the work and therefore expressed my interest. In the end, after all the wait, I am happy that at least I have been matched to a team that I really would like to work in.",

I think that if you do enough practice on the whiteboard, it would only make it easier for you in the interview.

I'm 45 years old and I have a 2.2 GPA.My friend at Google submitted my resume and I waited quite a while before I got a rejection letter. In retrospect, with them receiving 3000 resumes a day, it must be very easy to get lost in the shuffle unless your resume really stands out,\u2026\u00a0 and mine certainly did not. I waited a while and then contacted Google again and asked them to reconsider my resume, and they did. From that point on, it was an amazing process.Right away I got an email asking when would be a good time for a recruiter to talk with me (HR screen). I said, \"If not now, when?\" and 60 seconds later I got a call from the recruiter. We talked for 45 minutes and mostly it seemed like just fun chitchat. She asked about my experience and what I liked to work on and what languages I preferred. Then she said she would find an engineer suitable for me and would call me back soon. She called the next day and we scheduled a phone interview (tech screen) for the following week. She also send me an email about what to expect and things to brush up on.The next week I got the call from an engineer. We worked together in a Google Doc, and on the phone. He asked me about my resume, particularly my machine language experience. Then we did a bit manipulation problem, and I missed an obvious optimization. Then he asked me the main problem which was very clever. I came upon the solution very quickly, using recursion, but I screwed up on the complexity analysis. Afterwards, we chatted about Google life. It was a fun experience, but I figured I had blown it.I got a call from the recruiter an hour later telling me that the feedback was positive and that we would move on to the on-site interview. I spent a month in front of my white board practicing problems, especially from Gayle Laakmann's book, Cracking the Coding Interview. I read through Introduction to Algorithms , but there was just too much information in there to cram into my brain.At one point I was worried about my low 2.2 GPA and asked if I would be given a chance to explain the situation. I sent them an email and 30 seconds later one of the recruiters called me and said, basically, no one cares about your GPA. I get the impression that it's just a metric they use if there's nothing else on your resume to judge you by.I am not going to describe the interviews here. Sorry. Not only did I sign an NDA, but I also don't want to spoil it for anyone. I will just say this much: Those people who said, \"They asked me a simple CS101 question and I answered it and they still didn't hire me, those arrogant pricks!\", well, dude you completely missed the point of the exercise. It's really not about getting the \"right\" answer.The interviewers were all very cool. Some were reserved, and some were friendly and outgoing. I had a very fun time, but I missed a lot of simple things, didn't complete all of the problems, made simple syntax errors, and completely fumbled the interview that focused on Java. I left depressed, but feeling like I had been given a very fair chance.I got a call from a recruiter two days later saying that the interview feedback was \"pretty positive\" and that he decided to forward it to the Hiring Committee. The following Monday the Hiring Committee gave me a \"unanimous thumbs up\". Another recruiter emailed me to say she would be contacting my references and my application would go through the Compensation Committee and the Executive Committee. I was given a questionnaire to fill out, asking about past employment details and such. It also asked about any past achievements I may want the Executive Committee to know about. They said I would probably hear something in the next few weeks.Getting close to the end of the two week period, at 10:30pm, I got the email to \"extend me an offer\". When I replied to the email, she saw I was still awake so she called me on my cell phone at 11pm to give me the details as soon as possible. And the details were VERY generous, so I did not negotiate.Overall, it was an awesome experience. Everyone was super nice and polite. The whole thing took two months, but a month of that was me asking for time to prepare. I've heard of cases where they can push it through in two weeks if you re really in a hurry. They kept asking me if I had any time constraint that they needed to work with. Also, yes, I asked, and Larry Page did review and sign off on my final approval. From his own words, he's gotten so good at it that it takes him less than a minute for each one.I will only give this advice about the actual interview process: If you thought you aced it, you probably missed something. It's not about getting the \"right\" answer. It is about soooo much more. But, like I said, I don't want to spoil the fun.",

        "details": "I've been contacted by their recruiters every 6 months or year for the past 6 or 7 years. Finally I was in the right place in my career to actually interview there, so I agreed.The first step was a phone interview. The recruiter suggested a whole lot of studying material. I kinda skimmed \"Programming Interviews Exposed\", but I don't think it really made much of a difference at any point\u2026\u00a0 in the interview process. I feel like you either know your CS fundamentals or you don't and reading a book about them at the last minute isn't going to help much. Maybe I'm wrong.This is my best tip for interviewing!: don't just discount your first answer because you think it's \"too obvious\"! It very well might be the right answer, and now you'll be lost searching for an even better answer that doesn't exist! If you think it's not right, just say \"there might be a better way to do this, but I'm just brainstorming\", and then explain what you're thinking. If there's a better way to do it, they'll let you know. I made this mistake twice in my interviews.First there was a 45 minute phone interview. It was just two questions, one coding, and one more conceptual. It was pretty straightforward. The coding one was just something basic like implementing a binary search with a few tweaks.Despite all the scary things people say, I felt like the in-person interview wasn't especially difficult, but I probably just lucked out with the group of interviewers I pulled. My friend told me he knows a ton of really smart people who didn't pass the in-person, so I shouldn't take it personally if I didn't either. That helped me relax and realize I just had to go in there and do my best and see what happened. I wasn't really nervous then and the interview mostly just felt like I was discussing interesting problems with co-workers. I think being relaxed really helped me get the job, so if you can... chill out. :)Then things got really boring. At this point, it had been six weeks since I first started talking to the recruiter. Within three days, I was told that I'd passed the hiring committee. And after the I didn't get the offer for FOUR AND A HALF MORE WEEKS. That's 2.5 months total. The recruiter was very nice and apologetic about the whole process, but I feel like they need to do something to speed it up. It was a frustrating experience, knowing I'd passed the hiring committee and was probably hired, but then things just kept getting held up for weird reasons passing through all the other processes.When the offer finally came, however, it was a good offer and I accepted immediately.",

        "details": "A Google recruiter called me a few months back about having me apply for a Software Engineer position at their New York office. I was already employed in a good job at the time, so I was in two minds about exploring new opportunities. They set up a meeting for me with one of their engineers to clear any doubts or questions I may have about working at Google. This\u2026\u00a0 really helped with my decision to interview there, and I indicated to the recruiter that I would like to go ahead and interview with them. An on-site interview was scheduled within three weeks.The interviews started at 10:00AM at the Google offices in Manhattan (since I live in the area, I didn't need to travel, etc.), and were over by 3:00PM. There were 1-on-1 interviews by five of their engineers, each lasted about 45 minutes. One hour was set aside for lunch at the Google cafeteria (where all of the food is free and awesome), and one of their engineers was assigned as my \"host\" at the lunch to answer any questions I may have about life at Google. He also gave me a tour of their offices (which is very cool).All of the interviews were conducted in an \"interview room\" at the Google offices, which is a small meeting room consisting of a single (small) round table and a couple of chairs, a whiteboard and writing supplies. The interviewers (promptly) came to the room at their scheduled times and conducted their interviews for their 45 minutes, or until the next interviewer had arrived outside. Each of the interviews consisted of one or two math or algorithm problems. I was expected to first describe my general approach to the solution. After the interviewer was satisfied with the general approach, I was asked to write code on the whiteboard. I could use any programming language of my choice. I chose Java in almost all questions, and it seemed that most of the interviewers did their day-to-day work in C++. In any case, about half of the time was spent in the back and forth with the interviewer in coming up with the general approach to the problem -- I would come up with an approach, and the interviewer would point about certain cases that didn't work (or other conditions that needed to be met). The other half of the time was spent in planning and writing out the code on the whiteboard.Despite my background in research, none of the questions pertained to my background and experience. The questions were all designed to gauge fundamental problem-solving and algorithms expertise. It seemed like the interview questions were devised completely independently of my resume/background.Finally, during the last 15 minutes (2:45PM-3:00PM), I had a short \"debrief\" session with the HR guy, who gave me the opportunity to ask him any final questions I may have had, and to give him a little feedback about my experience that day. Overall it was a good interview experience -- very professional, all interviewers were well-prepared, punctual and respectful.",

We talked over the phone about the Google culture in general, the position and my experience. Also had to rate myself on a scale of 1 to 10 on my programming language of choice (Java). A date was set for a technical phone interview. I read\u2026\u00a0 up on my CS basics, my core programming language and some Google whitepapers.A software engineer contacted me at the exact agreed upon time. No small talk, straight to business. First question was about garbage collection in Java. Interviewer was looking for a very specific answer which I more or less could give. Next question was about memory leaks in Java and how to cause them. I wasn't aware of any way to do that, but apparently the substring method on a String object can cause it, first time I ever heard of it... Then he asked about pointer arithmetic. I gave him a generic description but he was looking for more detail. I explained that an array reserves a memory block where in principle one could use pointer arithmetic to get the next memory block reserved for an index in the array. By this time I got the sense that this was a C/C++ programmer proving the superiority of his language of choice over Java. Then he asked about the synchronized keyword's use on a method what guarantees it gives and how it behaves under different usecases, no problems there.Next came the programming task that I needed to resolve in a shared Google doc document. I had to implement encode / decode methods that would serialize/deserialize a binary tree. I didn't analyse the problem enough in advance and assumed he meant a balanced binary tree. After a while he gave me a hint that I was on the wrong track. I started again and got 2/3 through the exercise when the interview time was up.All in all I felt I didn't give a good impression, although I felt the questions weren't a good gauge of my skill level. The impression I got from the interviewer was pretty negative. It felt like he thought he was wasting his time from the beginning. Not a nice feeling. I sent an email to the recruiter explaining my impressions of the interview. After a few days I got an email from the recruiter tell me they wouldn't be continuing the interview process.

Also had a non-coding puzzle that I didn't entirely finish but had made progress on deconstucting/solving. Interviewers were nice, engaging and all had unique personalities. I left that day feeling extremely confident that I had done really well. Fast forward three weeks (minor nit\u2026\u00a0 -- the recruiter disappeared for two weeks w/o any contact -- very unprofessional. She did apologize later.) and I get a call from the recruiter saying that they will not be moving forward. I was shocked, to say the least. If that wasn't an outstanding interview on my part, then I don't know what is. Anyway, got the standard \"We can't give you any feedback for legal reasons but feel free to apply again in 12-18 months\".Based on all the interview experiences here, I wouldn't really sweat it too much if you don't get an offer and you believe you did well. As has been noted in the past, Google's interview process seems to be susceptible to false negatives and they can afford to turn good people away (which is certainly their right).Oh well, their loss :-)",

        "details": "I was contacted by a recruiter from Google Southern California (Irvine and Santa Monica) through LinkedIn and was asked if I had any interest in applying to Google. I replied yes and then had a phone call with the recruiter (about 40 minutes) to talk about my background and experience, and the recruiter talked about the interview process and answered all my questions. The recruiter was amazingly nice and very\u2026\u00a0 easy to talk to. The first thing I had to do was choose an office to apply to. I chose Santa Monica and asked for 2 weeks to study before the first phone interview.Two weeks later I had the phone interview. I was very nervous but my nerves calmed down as soon as I started talking to the interviewer, he was friendly and the interview felt more like we were a team working on a problem together rather than an interview (to some extent). It was very casual and the problems were interesting. The interviewer gave me a few tips and clues when I got stuck, but overall I felt like I did pretty well.One week later, the recruiter contacted me to announce I passed the phone interview and was invited to an onsite interview at the Santa Monica office. The onsite interview was scheduled for a week after that (so 2 weeks after the phone interview). I arrived at the building, but they have 3 buildings and I showed up at the wrong one! Way to make a good first impression, I felt so stupid. So if you have an interview there, make sure to follow the directions they give you by email instead of googling \"Google Santa Monica\" for the location.The onsite interview consisted of five 45 minutes 1:1 interviews back to back with a lunch with an engineer in the middle. Four of the interviewers were male software engineers in their early 30s, one was older (50s). All of them were nice and friendly and made the experience very pleasant. All but one of the interviewers made me feel like I was already part of the team and that we were just working together on a problem.The lunch was a little more awkward. The guy was older than me (50s) so we didn't have much in common (I am in my late 20s) and he was very hard to talk with. I had some questions and conversation topics ready to make sure the lunch would go smoothly, but I ran through all my questions in about 10 minutes because he only answered with \"yes\", \"no\", or a few words. He never asked me anything or made any effort to keep the conversation going. You could tell he was a nice guy, nothing wrong with him, just not a talker. Seems like a weird choice for a interviewee lunch, the whole thing felt like an uphill battle against awkward silence. The lunch was probably the most stressful part of the whole interview day!At the end of the day, I left the onsite interview feeling confident and happy. The problems had all been interesting and I really did enjoy most of the interviewers. One week later I received an email from the recruiter saying I was not selected for the job. I think I did pretty well, I guess I was not quite quick enough with my answers.",

        "details": "A google recruiter cold-called me on 3 Feb 2011 (I guess they got my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 from an old co-worker?) and I was kinda bored so I aksed her to send me more info about the job. The recruiter sounded eerily stoked on both the company and the project (kept describing it all as \"exciting\"). By the end of the next week we had scheduled a phone interview for 22 Feb.\u2026\u00a0 (I wasn't in any sorta hurry).Then I rescheduled the phone interview for a week later, 1 Mar. Shared google doc, the interviewer pasted some code and aksed me to find bugs in it and repair them. Some other question I don't remember. The topics were like race conditions in multi-threaded systems or something. It was nothing shocking, and the interviewer seemed to have a more muted stoke about working for google.Two days later, the ultra-stoked recruiter called back with a second recruiter to invite me for an in-person. The second recruiter sounded pretty hepped up on the brand-name too. I think the second was a more senior recruiter. We scheduled an interview for 2 weeks later, 17 Mar.They put me up in a hotel in Mtn View. The hotel was perfectly fancy, and had lots of nerd-themed items in the desk in the room (think weird Rubik's Cubes, puzzles made of heavy wire, &c). Next morning I woke up and drove to the googleplex. It was pretty, with ample parking, and a kinda agrestic setting. Flowers, vegetables, nerds. I waited in building 43 and watched people come in and out. it was easy to tell the difference between the home team and the visitors -- the googlers were the ones who looked super-jazzed, and the others looked uneasy.I mean, noticeably super-jazzed.The senior recruiter came `round and took me to the first interview room. I'd been scheduled for three interviews, but he told me they had found a fourth interviewer and would I mind staying longer for more probing. (I said I wouldn't mind.) The first interviewer came in, aksed a question about like statefulness in distributed systems or something, I wrote a big long answer on the board. he was mellow, genial, and helpful. The interview question wasn't too hard, and afterwards (when prompted) he expressed satisfaction with the company. He left, and another helpful, genial, and mellow engineer came in and aksed me some more basic cs stuff, and a question about how to build the back-end of a particular google product. She also expressed contentment with google as a place of employment.The guy who gave me the phone interview came and took me to lunch.We went to yet another building for my next interviews. A frankly-kinda-stressed-out-seeming engineer aksed questions about code prettification: namely, how to prettify the Java code I wrote on the white board. She took me to the next interview where a young guy aksed me a question about c-language bit-twiddling, and aksed a question about dynamic programming. my undergraduate cs courses were like 18 years previous, and I drew a blank. after futzing around w/ it for a bit, time was called and I drove home.I sorta figured that it would end there, so I wasn't suprised when they didn't call back. Two weeks later though, the senior recruiter called back to tell me they almost had all the interview reports, and that they just needed one guy's report before making a decision.Three days later, around 5 Apr, both recruiters started calling me and emailing me. I ignored them for a while, then finally phoned them back. They said they wanted me to talk with a few potential teams there to see if we could find a match.Over the next two weeks I spoke with six or seven folks, engineers and managers both. The tone of the calls went from testing my domain-awareness to openly soliciting my membership in their teams.Eventually (over the course of about a week) the recruiter reported the progress of my hiring order from hiring committee to I guess a second hiring committee to some kind of executive committee to the compensation manager to the executive approval, then they phoned me to tell me the nitty-gritty of the job offer.It was pretty good, so I accepted.",

I got flight info for two days later, flew out, interviewed the next day (Friday), and had an offer by\u2026\u00a0 Monday.At the on-site interview, they put you up in a pretty nice hotel and provide a rental car. GPS is recommended, as the Mountain View / Sunnyvale suburbs can be difficult to navigate.The Google campus is simply spectacular. They have dozens of buildings, with bikes for transportation between bulidings, buses in and out of different neighborhoods, multiple dining cafes, multiple gyms, etc. Google is also located all over the country (and world) - you can actually pick your location if MV suburbia isn't your cup of tea. Projects/teams are distributed across separate offices.As for the actual interview:5 separate 45 minute interviews with other Software Engineers. The interviewers come from a wide background (infrastructure, front end, etc). Questions were all technical in nature, mostly coding oriented. They did ask pointed questions about previous experience, projects, general resume stuff, etc.The interview questions were well thought out and relatively innovative. The interviewers presented them clearly, and were very helpful in discussing solution possibilities. Some of the questions were pretty straightforward, but the trickier ones were excellent - we were able to devise solutions and optimize them multiple times, discussing what was better about different approaches.Everyone I talked to was very upbeat, intelligent, and nice. The last interviewer I had seemed a bit surly at first, but quickly warmed up and became very affable.The hiring process was very informative. The recruiters gave loads of information when asked, and were very up front about a lot of aspects of the company. The interviewers themselves were able to answer many questions about the gritty details of working at Google.The hiring itself is actually done by a separate group of people from the interviewers, and is decided somewhat up the chain of command.",

After the tour we went straight to the interview room for the mini-interviews. The interviewers were all software\u2026\u00a0 engineers. Despite being asked to pick top competencies, the interviewers ignored this, ignored the resume, ignored even basic background questions, and jumped straight into algorithms questions. We would progress through several problems until the interviewer found one which I didn't know off the top of my head. At one point I was asked to derive an efficient parallel multi-core algorithm on the spot and the point of the interview was revealed as \"stump the applicant.\" Despite explaining the algorithms, the interviewers insisted they be written out long hand on a small whiteboard without regard of how long was left in the interview.One interviewer revealed that interviewers were allowed to come up with their own problems whether or not they had considered the solution. Interviewers provided zero feedback, and once time ran out the interviewer proclaimed \"this interview is now over\" and left the room. One interviewer claimed that any extra time left over would be \"rewarded\" with the ability to ask him questions about the job or environment. This is indicative of the office attitude.

I had 3 phone interviews and 4 one-on-one interviews (on-site). All of the interviews were extremely well-prepared. All interviews stayed exactly or less than 45 minutes. They seem to be very strict as to the duration of each interview. So if\u2026\u00a0 there was a tip I would give, it is to not talk too much and let the interviewer ask his questions so you have more time to solve the technical problems. In the end, this is what will matter.I would study up on at least the following: BFS, DFS, Hashtables, String Manipulation, Trees.For my level (3 years out of college) I did not find the algorithm questions to be anything that would be too hard. They are all answerable within 45 minutes. The key is to be able to understand the problem and identify an efficient solution as fast as possible. Also, the implementation is very key. Knowing to use BFS is not enough, you need to be able to implement it very fast too.I cannot provide you guys with the exact questions because I respect Google's NDA. However, the following are the kinds of questions that I was asked. I think as long as you are able to comfortably and accurately answer those types of questions in 45 minutes you will be fine (I usually get asked 2 algorithm questions in a 45 minute session).",

        "details": "January 2011, Mt.View campusVisited Google first 5 years ago, that time was rejected. This time contacted by recruiter again, offered to come for the interview again.Sweeping Silicon Valley rumor mill brought several facts about interview practices \u2013 each interviewer has to submit rather detailed report to the hiring committee recording after you everything written on the white board and allegedly even recording what you say. Sometime 2 interviewers are talking\u2026\u00a0 to the candidate, in such cases second person is a trainee. Sometimes there are two rounds if Google is uncertain. Candidate has to select programming language of preference for the interview (my choice was C as I was applying to what recruiter called \u201ckernel\u201d positions in ChromeOS team).Was first met by the recruiter, he spent 10 mins with me, I asked about the practices above, even though he confirmed, but downplayed \"exact recording of what candidate says part\". Answered that written report on a candidate is about 1-2 typed pages on average.Total met 6 people, 5 technical, one lunchFirst interviewer:1. General discussion on testing methodologies (why unit tests might fail?)2. Asked me to code review some C++ code even though I explicitly selected that my language of preference is C. Couldn't say much as I don't use C++.3. Asked to implement C++ method for a class \"arbitrary reader\" given we have a class 4K reader which can read only 4K blocks.Second interviewer:1. Given two binary search trees, write function which tells if two such trees are the same \u2013 (i.e. same info in the nodes, same branching to left and right at every node).Recursive implementation was presented. Was asked to do non-recursive version (question was not about better solution, say, w/constant memory) \u2013 I proposed to change recursive algorithm to non-recursive with a user-defined stack (formal transformation rather boring but doable, FORTRAN people do it). Demonstrated that but code was messy with gotos, etc. Asked about complexity \u2013 both recursive and non-recursive versions required linear stack in worst case of pathological one-sided trees.Third interviewer:1. Reverse bits in 32-bit integer.2. Given two large files with 64-bit integers produce file with integers which are present in both files and estimate O(?) complexity of your algorithm.Proposed solution of splitting both files in n chunks (k integers in each) and solving n^2 subproblems while incrementally updating the result by merging sorted files of partial results (we will need to sort each chunk once). After algorithm was finalized, we checked the complexity and it was something cubic by n and k. Too bad. Navigated me to the solution to sort both files and find intersection by merging, this was better. As an afterthought I still think that when files do not have large overlap my solution might be winning as sorting original large files is not required (k should be selected so that each chunk could be sorted in memory, how about n=k=sqrt(file-size)?:).3. One has a stream of queries coming over a day, how do you keep a cache of 1000 most-frequently used ones? Did not have time for this one.Fourth interviewer:1. Asked light technical questions on past items listed in resume.2. When you are doing \"read()\" call what it happening under the hood in user space? (answer needs to clarify how it is translated to a system call by libc).3. How to find a median in a large file of 64-bit integers.I mentioned first the classical \"order statistics\" algorithm with splitting initial group into 5-tuples and finding median of medians, etc. My proposal on the problem was toadopt median algorithm to the case when we are dealing with large file \u2013 however no additional disk space could be used, it should be done \"in place\" and it is not clear for me if order statistics algorithm could be done easily with such restriction. Interviewer downplayed the order statistics deal and navigated me to the solution that I liked \u2013 keep in memory counters for binary intervals practically counting occurences of prefixes (say, 24-bit prefixes). After that we are able to tell what prefix range the median belongs to, recalculate index of the element to search instead of median and go over the particular prefix range and find it there. Sweet.After two week got rejection as not matching with current open positions.",

I initially indicated that Google wouldn't be a good fit because I didn't want to live in California, but he mentioned other offices, including the one in Boulder.

During the interview I was asked to solve a series of technical problems,\u2026\u00a0 including describing algorithms and providing big-O complexities. The questions started out fairly simple but rapidly increased in difficulty and complexity.The second part was a day-long in-person interview. Google flew me to Boulder for it. I had five one-hour interviews, each similar to the phone screen, except for the middle one which wasn't really an interview... it was lunch, with a chance to discuss the company with a Googler (as it turns out, my lunch \"interviewer\" is now my manager, so it was a great chance to get to know him).After the interview, it took about two weeks to get an answer from Google, and another week to get an offer. That was strange to me; in my experience decisions and offers usually come quicker. I've since learned how the process works, and because of the structure of the process, my experience is typical. The offer was so good that even though my family wasn't excited about moving to Colorado, there really was no question. I've since learned that very, very few people turn down Google's offers.",

        "details": "I greatly anticipated this interview. Many engineers, including me, wants an opportunity to work with the best and the brightest. But the interview went wrong in many ways, and it changed my mind about wanting to work at Google. The on site interview was 3 sessions 45 minutes each.1) The recruiter was incredibly slow. It took almost three weeks for the on site to be scheduled. He often promised to\u2026\u00a0 get back to me tomorrow, then I don't hear from him for 5 days. It was frustrating working with him. But I kind of expected this since my friends who interviewed before had similar experience.2) The first interviewer had a strong accent. I couldn't understand him so I had to ask him to repeat many times. I felt like I was being rude, but thinking back, his inability to explain the questions was cutting into my time to answer them. Then he asked me to review some C++ code. Wait a minute, I am a Java programmer and the recruiter said the interview will be conducted in Java. The last time I used C++ was 7 years ago. I explained it to him, but he insisted, I gave it my best shot while struggling with syntax.3) The second interviewer was arrogant and rude! He seemed like he didn't want to be there. Again, asked me to code a problem that is only relevant in C++. I gave it the best answer in Java. He argued with me that it will not work, then I had to explain to him null assignment in Java also deallocates a variable because of GC. He wouldn't admit he was wrong, so he made a degrading comment about how Java programmer knows nothing about memory management. Then he asks a harder question basically requires putting everything in a hashmap then check for a match. He rudely interrupts me while I tried to explain my thoughts. At one point, I literally got a little angry. I happen to be a pretty patient and none confrontational person. I think he had a canned answer in mind, and he didn't want to listen to anything else.4) The third interviewer was 7 minutes late, but he was nicer. He seemed cocky about working at google. Many things he said started with something like \"at google, this is how we do...\". The questions he asked was a little confusing. I had to ask many follow up questions to understand it.If they are looking for someone with C++ skills, then why waste half day of my time. After meeting these interviewers, I recognized that my friends, who work at google, have the same arrogance. The same arrogance a Microsoft recruiter once shown me when I first graduated from college. Look at where they are now. Google is on track to become just like them.

        "details": "Google recruiter picked my Linkedin profile and contacted me. Initial phone conversation with her was followed by the first phone interview with a manager (each manager I talked to stressed he was totally hands-on, just like other developers, plus carried managerial responsibilities). I'd say this was probably true based on the types of questions he asked. He mostly asked me about my current and past jobs, projects, accomplishments, approaches to\u2026\u00a0 design, team work, etc - pretty much \"traditional\" relaxed semi-technical interview questions. This one went extremely well, as per my recruiter's feedback.The next one also went well - now with the team lead for the group they wanted me for. A few design questions, one technology question (what do you think of using technology X for solving the problem Y?). Plus one pretty simple algorithm that I was asked to explain on the phone, although my recruiter initially told me about coding using Google's online collaborative tools. It was awkward to just \"talk\" through the algorithm, instead of writing and talking as I normally do.Finally, on-site interview. They said they would only have four people to interview me, plus the fifth one would take me for lunch and answer any off-record questions. Bummer - I thought there would be more people, meaning more challenges, but also more chances to show my skills. Four people seemed too few.Personal interviews turned into a problem right away.First, no one cared about my professional career and accomplishments. Took me off-guard - is it because they think it's irrelevant to Google? In any event, it's their way, so having figured out their style in the first half an hour I tried just to accept it and move on.The second problem turned out to be a killer: in most cases I totally misinterpreted the intent and scope of their questions, and I am still not quite sure if was my fault.One guy asked to sketch the design of some distributed system. I enumerated all the typical issues - distribution, scalability, database synchronization, etc and how to approach them. The guy kept asking more questions, but I thought he was not satisfied and had no clue why. Finally - after good half an hour, he said he basically just wanted me to write the algorithm, that would perform the core function of the entire system, which was computing some stats on the data collected in real-time by that very distributed system. All the challenges of distributed systems design turned out _not_ to be what he was after! Why not to scope the question clearly from the beginning? I gave the best shot at the algorithm, which was trivial, compared to the types of algorithms I do at work. By then I was slightly pissed off by what happened, so I got the right answer pretty slow by my own standards. It almost appeared as if I spent the whole interview trying to write one trivial algorithm!In that and some other questions, I should have basically ignored much of their content, focusing instead on identifying some core algorithm working on idealized data sets - while the way questions were stated would make you think that the core was designing distributed systems collecting such data!One week later recruiter told me they'd passed on me due to insufficient algorithmic skills - with the algorithms as simple as the ones asked, that was pretty ironic. I was told everyone liked me on all other accounts, and that the recruiter will contact me in 6 to 8 months to re-try the whole thing. I am not sure if I want to pursue it, but I might.Having known what I know now (not specific questions, but the expectations behind them), I would've, probably, passed that interview easily. The take-out lesson for me - they are into algorithms and little else, even for senior positions. When approaching their questions, try to start with some simple algorithm expressing the core idea, and ignore everything else - even if this \"everything else' constitutes the main challenge in real-life development! If you just write this algorithm down correctly, you score. If their question was more involved, they will probably tell you, but you'll score anyway.Regardless of whether I personally think that Google's interviewing practices are conducive to hiring the best people (I don't), it is their way, so you just have to accept it if you want to get in.",

All in all, pretty algorithm-specific, very little attention paid to OOD skills, requirements analysis etc.Finally, to give them credit, the onsite interview was Friday, and the decision was made the following Monday because I asked them to accomodate my schedule.

        "details": "I was contacted directly by a recruiter, we exchanged a few emails and talked for a few minutes about past experience, skills, interests, etc. After I agreed to continue with the process, I had a phone interview, an on-site interview, was told that they'll contact my references and then received the offer. 1-3 weeks passed between each step. The recruiter talked me through the process and kept me informed about\u2026\u00a0 the progress of my application, but the process itself is rather opaque: you do not get to know exactly what you could be working on, you're unlikely to meet people you will be working with, and you do not get much feedback until the offer / no offer. Hiring decisions are made by committee(s) (i.e. not by a hiring manager who has an opening in his team), and although the recruiters may have a good feeling of which direction the application is going, they cannot promise anything until the decision is made.The phone interview was with one software engineer for 45-60 mins. After a few ice-breaking questions, they jumped into a few technical questions and then gave me a few minutes for my questions. The on-site interview consisted of 5 1-1 technical interviews of 45 minutes each with software engineers, plus a lunch break in one of the cafeterias with another engineer; In total I probably answered 20-30 different questions on data structures, algorithms, and discrete maths. You write down the answers on a whiteboard or notebook and the interviewers take notes. Sometimes correct syntax is required, sometimes pseudocode is acceptable. The level of the questions varied a lot and covered a lot of areas: one minute I am manipulating the bits of a byte to implement one coding trick, the next I am discussing heuristics for an intractable problem. Most interviewers gave me a few minutes at the end to ask them questions, and the discussions touched briefly on my past experience although I was not expected (and one really shouldn't) give too much information on my current work; keep in mind that the interviewee signs an NDA but the interviewers don't.In my current job I do a fair amount of interviewing and I often interview candidates who give the impression of being competent but fall short of doing well in the technical interview because they're unprepared. This often leads to a no-hire decision, probably an unfortunate false negative, but hiring decisions are very hard to make since bad recruits are a severe liability to an engineering team. I did not want to be such a candidate so I prepared as best as I could; luckily the process was slow enough to give me some time to do that. I read (and worked through the exercises of) textbooks on algorithms, datastructures, discrete maths, the languages I use, practiced my handwriting, brushed up on standard CS topics I do not currently use, and learned a bit about Google specific technology like MapReduce. I also brushed up on my past research/experience and areas related to that. I was not asked on most of what I prepared on, and I was asked on areas I did not think of preparing on, but I think that this preparation really helped me to be in the right mindset to solve the type of questions I was asked. In my opinion, good knowledge in the fundamentals is essential but the most important skill is problem solving. I was asked questions about areas I'm not familiar with, but (with some help from the interviewers) I was able to break them down into smaller components I could at least tackle. I probably didn't impress in those questions but it was better than throwing in the towel. I was not asked directly on specific datastructures and algorithms, but if I decided to use some to solve a problem, then I was asked detailed questions about them. So: problem solving is the skill, CS knowledge provides the tools.I have negligible experience of being an interviewee, and it's amazing all the silly mistakes my nerves made me do; I really felt that I had misrepresented myself as being clumsy (at least more than I am...), but luckily it is a myth that one mistake is enough to fail the whole process. I did not feel the arrogance in the interviewers mentioned in other reviews here. Not all of them made me feel comfortable, but overall they're what you expect from a silicon valley company. Before the application proceeded, I couldn't tell how I did, but I felt that it was a fair process, and definitely a positive experience that left me with a very good impression of Google; If you are good at the fundamentals, be able to show a level of expertise on everything you list in your resume, have spent the time to prepare, and you're not intimidated by relentless questioning, possibly on areas you're not that familiar with, then you have a good chance of satisfying enough interviewers to move on to the next step. Keep in mind that Google affords to be picky so their hiring process tries to minimize hiring bad recruits at the cost of rejecting potentially good ones.",

        "details": "I was contacted by a Google recruiter by phone. My resume was on file from a previous interview 3 years ago which did not result in an offer. We had a short conversation about what was available at Google and about what my experience was. The questions and information were very high level and it didn't seem like this was even a phone screen of any sort.She then passed me\u2026\u00a0 on to the HR person at the NY office. I was told that there would be a phone interview where I would need to be at a computer and would need to be able to code, but since I has already been onsite previously they decided to skip this. I was handed on to yet another person to actually schedule the interview and then back to the HR person.The onsite interview was from 10 to 3 and consisted of 5 interviews and a lunch conversation. Each interview was 45 minutes and they ran pretty much right on schedule. They were difficult, but pretty much what was expected. There almost no discussion of work history or anything other than technical questions. Most of the time was spent at the whiteboard working on and then refining the answer to a question. They mainly focused on data structures and algorithms around them. Things like BST, hash tables, tree traversals. The questions were not standard algorithm questions that you tend to see around, but a bit more involved. They were interested in your speaking about the algorithmic complexity of your solution and how to choose appropriate data structures. Hash vs. BST came up a bit. The coding that had to be done was a bit awkward for a whiteboard. The solutions were not necessarily short. One interview revolved around a higher level system design question that was refined throughout the discussion. There was very little to no time to ask questions or discuss working at google and the inteviewers did not seem interested in selling me on google. The lunch conversation was not an interview and did not contribute towards the assessment. The person I ate with was very nice and seemed honest about the way things are at google.Over 2 weeks after the interview I was contacted with the rejection.Overall the process was smooth and people were helpful and nice. Though I did not find anyone to be particularly interested in selling the company. The interviewers were hard but fair for the most part. One interviewer did not describe the problem particularly well and had me coding a solution to the wrong problem for a while.",

        "details": "The interesting parts of the Google interview process are all under NDA and you can't discuss them for two years after the interview. Here's what I can tell you:- Their initial contact with me was via email, through LinkedIn. I didn't contact them.- Two rounds of telephone interviews are required for out-of-state candidates (i.e. anybody they will have to pay to fly in). Both interviews will have a \"take home\u2026\u00a0 assignment\" portion - a piece of code that you'll have to write and email to your interviewer within a fixed time (1 hour for me). If you pass these hurdles you'll be brought out to Mountain View for an all-day in-person interview.- Travel arrangements are absolutely painless, it's all handled for you and all you need to do is write an email and pick dates.- Google flies you in on day X, interview day X+1, fly out day X+2; no redeyes necessary. They pay for flight, hotel, rental car, and per diem for meals. You get to pick airlines and rental companies for frequent flyer miles. Note that you have to put your meals and the rental car on your own credit card, and file for reimbursement. They say to allow several weeks for reimbursement, but my experience was that the money arrived by direct deposit in about a week after filing. If you wish to stay extra days to explore the neighborhood and pay for the additional rental car and hotel expenses yourself, that's fine.The interviews are extremely technical and involve real programming exercises, manipulating data structures, analyzing or describing algorithms, etc. Be prepared to iterate what you're doing on the board. Be ULTRA prepared with knowledge of standard search and sort algorithms and junior-level CS data structures; also be aware of their big-O complexity. While the interview questions aren't exactly complicated, they cover so much territory that there is no way to study for them from \"cold\". If you are not programming on a daily basis in the languages in which you're being interviewed, you will not pass these tests.The process moves extremely quickly - at most a day or two between steps. Depending on how your scheduling works, you could go from first contact to an offer in less than two weeks.Absolutely everything you have read about Google perks and benefits is entirely true.

My experience is in NLP, and I specifically applied to Google for a job doing NLP, either in machine translation, speech recognition, or one of the other many NLP tasks they do. My Google interviews were the first ones I had out of college, and I was still naive enough to believe I'd be asked about the\u2026\u00a0 stuff I've done and that I'm applying to do. Wrong.HR apparently just switched my application to a generic new grad job, so the only questions I was asked were generic sorting algorithms and stuff like that. Not a word about machine learning or NLP. Just sorting algorithm basics that I haven't seen since sophomore year and have never and probably will never need to touch in the work place. I've since learned from later interviews and from friends who interviewed at other places: if you're interviewing for anything in software development, there's about a 95% chance you'll only be asked generic technical questions that have nothing to do with the position you're applying for, or the things you'll be working on. It's really sad that even at a top company like Google, this is still the case. I guess you just have to play the system.",

        "details": "Applied for a Software Engineer position. I was contacted by a recruiter for some general questions and background information. I was then instructed that I'd be receiving a call the following week from another software engineer for a technical screening. The engineer called me and went over a few technical questions regarding mainly javascript and running time (big O). I was then asked to provide 2 algorithms in code within\u2026\u00a0 an hour after the call. Overall the interview seemed to go well....as so I thought.I wasn't contacted until the following week of the results. I was turned down but they cannot give you any information of why you didn't meet their standards. They won't tell you if your code is wrong, where you went wrong or where you could improve as a developer. Just a standard \"your skills don't meet our needs at this time\" response. Kind of disappointing given that you prepare for hours upon hours of your time and energy and receive 0 feedback.How can you prepare? Well, I went over all of my old CS 101 notes, hash tables, data structures, and all the theory behind it. It can be a bit overwhelming if you haven't visited that information for over a decade. My advice is to brush up on your theory and write some practical examples along those lines, like sorting an array using Merge sort in your favorite language. Don't worry about trying to get better in your languages...you either know it now or don't know it.It's nearly impossible to prepare for everything for this position given that they don't hire a Javascript developer or C++ developer. They just hire developers in general and only the top 1% developers in the world, as they indicated. Don't bother asking about the position because you could be working on any number of projects and they will not give you any specifics.Overall, I rate the experience a 2.5 out of 5. The interview questions I got weren't terribly difficult, but I don't know where I went wrong or how I could improve since no feedback is given. That's where Google's policy needs to be revamped. The people I talked to were nice but don't expect any personality. It's very dry and straightforward and I'm not really sure if that's indicative of how people are there. The youtube video on working at Google seems like it's such a great place to work, but can't really say for sure at this time given my experience thus far with how they approach engineers.",

We talked about Google's recruiting process, but not so much about my background, education, and career interests. I made sure she had my latest resume and I asked some questions about work-life balance in the Seattle office and also about Google's IP/non-compete policies. After the call I emailed times I would be available for two back-to-back technical phone interviews.Received email from recruiter on 2009-10-15 confirming my scheduled time for two back-to-back technical phone interviews. Email included information about types of software engineer positions in the office and links to various Google pages (Labs, Code, lifeatgoogle Youtube channel) and Yegge's advice article. Also asked me to answer a few preliminary questions about myself to ensure I don't have any conflicts.Received call from first Google engineer as scheduled on 2009-10-20. He described his work in Gmail on contact management and chat, mainly using C++. He asked me to describe a big project I've worked on and I told him about my thesis and its accompanying software implementation. He then asked some technical questions. I asked him about his work-life balance in that office and asked him if working there is anything like what you read about in Hamming's \"You and Your Research.\"After the interview I hung out for a couple hours waiting for the next phone call but it never came. I contacted the recruiter and she informed me that the second interviewer was unable to access his calendar and was unable to call. We rescheduled the second interview.Received phone call from second engineer as rescheduled on 2009-10-23. He told me how he works on Google Maps and used to work on Talk at the Kirkland office. He asked me to talk about my thesis and I did, but for some reason I got really nervous talking about it this time. Voice was shaky for a while. After that he asked two technical questions. I asked him about his work-life balance at that office and what his most interesting use of Google's tremendous resources has been.I was told by both engineers that I would hear from the recruiter soon so I waited for a week and a half or so. On 2009-11-04 I emailed the recruiter asking if we would be proceeding with the interview and later that evening I received a call from her stating the engineers enjoyed talking to me but we would not be moving forward.The overall process was enjoyable, even when I was an anxious wreck. The technical interviews boosted my confidence, even though I stumbled on the easiest questions (postorder & basic C programming). The first engineer was far more polite & humble than the second one, but the second one was certainly civil enough. The recruiter was kind, easy to talk to, and obviously put effort into answering all of my tough questions about the Seattle/Kirkland offices & Google policies.I learned that the Seattle/Kirkland offices tend to be a little more laid-back than the Mountain View office. Also, Google does make you sign a non-compete but it's not overly draconian. Many engineers run their own companies after hours and are even allowed to use AdWords and whatnot, provided they sign some agreements.

Google insists on hiring really smart people and putting them on somewhat random projects. During the interview process they will tell you nothing about what you'll be working on, in fact they don't even know until the day you start! This is ridiculous when you are trying to hire engineers with difficult to find specialty skills. These same people are getting compelling offers from other companies who are willing to let them work on stuff in their domain of expertise and are willing to tell then what they'll work on.Google treats all of its new hires like they are fresh out of college. I.e. they are smart, but have little experience so they'll be ready to just work on anything just because its Google. Sadly this is simply not true of the more experience senior people out there.",

Binary trees, BFS, DFS, Dynamic Programming, Prefix/Suffix trees, Heaps, Hash tables, and\u2026\u00a0 so forth. I knew all the important algorithms and data structures and I practiced enough to know how to apply them in clever ways. I also did a lot of leetcode questions without much difficulty, including most of the \"hard\" ones.Despite all this I still failed the interview. Frustratingly, the question really wasn't that difficult. It didn't require any advanced algorithms knowledge. Without going into specifics, what needed to be done was to go through an array, for each index recognize one out of three cases, and update some variables accordingly. What went wrong is that I didn't take my time to think this simple problem through. Instead I started coding immediately, produced something messy, and kept on trying to fix this mess. Understandably, this didn't make a good impression.So, my advice to anyone facing the same situation is the following: First of all, relax. Don't be afraid to take some time to think about the problem before you code, so that you know what you're doing once you start coding. Also don't be afraid to stop, rethink, and start over, if you feel you got stuck. Apart from that, always think out loud and listen to the hints of the interviewer.Also, practice coding in a plain text document.

The recruiter said that he would send me information about what type of questions would be asked during the phone interview. He also said he would contact me again a little bit before the date of the interview. I never received any news anymore from the recruiter! A little while before the interview was supposed to happen I started working at another company. Given the previous experience I actually didn't expect them to call me. Surprisingly, they did! However, given how they treated me, and I was at my new job, I also stood them up. Afterwards, the recruiter emailed me again to ask me what happened.

After a brief chat over the phone with the recruiter I had a phone interview with the technical guy (an employee). The technical guy had a heavy Australian accent on top of speaking to me over a loudspeaker. I am used to American accent and understanding his speech\u2026\u00a0 required extra efforts of mine in addition to not hearing him properly because of his loudspeaker. I'd have asked him to switch to a \"normal\" microphone mode but being already very stressed I didn't think about that during the interview.I applied for a fresh grad position and this interview was one of the first interviews I had in my life.The guy asked me to write down an algorithm for a problem. But before that he spent about 20 minutes of basically bragging about himself. I know that it's normal for an interviewer to introduce himself and his projects but his talk was more than that!He gave a basic description of the problem and the trick was to ask more questions in order to come up with the properly working algorithm. The guy didn't make any efforts for giving me clues or trying to lead me through the solution. He was just like \"Huh, ok, then what\" or \"Huh, ok\". I felt he was waiting for the interview to be over asap.I'd have solved that problem but I was very nervous in part for being interviewed by Google, in part for not understanding properly what he was saying, and in part for his arrogance.I immediately sensed his arrogance after he asked me this question: \"Have you worked with large systems?\" To which I replied \"Yes, the number of nodes ranged from X to Y\" (which was already the max number for computing in my domain), and then he, with sensible ridicule in his intonation, said something like \"Huh, this is not a big number.\"Everyone knows that Google has way way bigger numbers in their systems, but that doesn't mean that the interviewer has a right to belittle the experience of the candidates, nor to expect from a fresh grad to have worked on the Google-scale-like systems.I can't disclose the technical question asked during the interview, because you already know why.",

The key thing again was to demonstrate your ability to arrive at a solution, rather than directly solve it.I do not think the questions were very difficult, but in some sense my nervousness got the better of me and even though i had solved a lot of similar questions during my preparation, i jumped to conclusions on the answer and delivered incomplete answers.Overall, my experience with the entire hiring process right from the time of the first call till the end was very good.

Recruiter sent me an email asking when we could talk. I answered specifying when I have time for a phone call. Then there was over\u2026\u00a0 a week of silence, and finally recruiter called me on different hour that I specified. He said that he has one possible date for phone interview, so I accepted.2. My first phone interview did not happen, because interviewer did not show up. Interview was rescheduled.3. Second interview went smoothly. I answered all the questions, and interviewer seemed satisfied with the answers.4. The same day recruiter called me and said that my evaluation was inconclusive and we need another phone interview. I asked for technical feedback, but I was not given any. The only information that I received was that \"my solution was not good enough\".5. Second interview went similar to the first one. Again I answered all the questions. This time interviewer even said that he is satisfied with my answers.6. After a week recruiter called me and said that evaluation was inconclusive again, and this ends recruitment process. I asked for technical feedback, and he said that he does not have any, but he will contact me when he get one.7. After two weeks without information, I tried to contact my recruiter by email. Then again by phone.8. After a month I received anonymous survey about my interview experience. I used it to complain about lack of information from recruiter and the fact that I still do not know why I was rejected.9. The next morning I got a call from my recruiter. He apologized for not contacting me earlier and gave me technical feedback from my two interviews. I learned that first call I failed because my solution was not optimal (it was O(N log N) when O(N) was possible). On the second call I implemented optimal algorithm, but there were several issues with implementation that led to lowering my evaluation to \"neutral\". And two neutral opinions are not enough to qualify.Overall, recruiter never answered any of my emails, and each time we talk he was condescending and unfriendly. Overall it was frustrating and disheartening experience.",

            "First interview -Warmup:The interviewer asked me a series of short questions. The running time (best, worst, average) of various sorting algorithms such as merge sort, quick sort and heapsort. He also asked me about hash table and hash functions (average and worst case complexity of insertion, deletion and lookup).Central Question:Consider a setup where a program is continuously receiving floats as inputs (a stream of numbers). The task is to write\u2026\u00a0 a method that at any given time returns a moving average. That is the average of the last k numbers received. If the method is called before the program has received k numbers, simply return the average of however many numbers have been received thus far. The solution should obviously be optimal.Second interview -Warmup: Given an array of integers, write a method that places all the zeros at the end.Main question: Consider an interface which has the following two methods:interface Counter {\u00a0\u00a0void inc();\u00a0\u00a0int getLastMinuteCount();}The method inc() is supposed to help keep track of the number of requests that clients make to a server (or something else along those lines). The getLastMinuteCount() is supposed to return the number of requests that the server has received in the last minute. The question is to implement a class that has these two methods included. \u00a0"

        "details": "Contacted by a recruiter after a former co-worker from another company that is now in Google recommended me.First screening interview was on site since I live close to Google's offices in Tel-Aviv.Small algorithm/data-structure question with coding in C++ and a bit of STL.The interviewer was not very nice, snobish and condescending, yet I passed without any issues and was invited to a full on-site interviews day at a later date.The\u2026\u00a0 on-site interviews included 3 interviews focusing on algorithm/data-structures including a bit of coding. Nothing very difficult, but requiring good knowledge of topics like trees/lists traversal, dynamic programming, binary search, etc.One interview was on C++ knowledge, basic stuff like virtual functions, multiple inheritance, etc. with a small algorithm and coding question.Last interview was a design interview - design an image sharing system in which users can upload images, then get a short URL unique for their image and use it in forum messages, social networks posts, emails, etc.I was told by the recruiter that the feedback was mixed but with enough support for passing to the hiring committee.Then I was rejected and told by recruiter that the design interview is the cause. I find this decision very wrong, considering what I accomplished in my career and am sure 100% that any former colleague of mine would testify very positively on my design skills, but think back on the design interview I'm not surprised:The interviewer gave me a pen and papers so I could draw and write my design, but as soon as he finished asking the question he picked a pen and paper and started solving it himself, he seemed to be in a hurry to reach exactly the solution that he expects. He was not nice, arrogant and unpleasant to talk to and have an open discussion.In total 3 of the 6 interviewers were not people I would like to work with, while the other 3 were very nice and were fun to talk to and think together.I wasn't asked even once on my work experience or any of my past projects, no single \"behavior\" question like \"describe a scenario in which you had a conflict\", etc. and wasn't asked why I would like to join Google or what I'm looking for in a work place.It seems the entire process revolves around solving technical questions and nothing beyond that, so it's not surprising to me that 3 of 6 interviewers (in my opinion of course) had such bad people skills.I constantly had the feeling that the interviewers (all of them) prefer meek and inexperienced candidates, that can be shaped and trained to think exactly like them and would not show independent or out-of-the-box thinking.*** It actually felt to me like my experience and knowledge is an obstacle or a disadvantage instead of an asset that the company would and should appreciate !!! ***Other than that - I enjoyed solving the questions, food was great (and the engineer that escorted me was very nice and friendly, we had interesting discussions), the offices look and feel great. The recruiter was super friendly, always kept me informed and did his best to speed up the process, I have only good words to say about him.I later passed successfully interviews in other companies (including Google's competitors), some of which were more difficult, and received excellent offers from great work places, and I definitely think the process in Google leads to bad decisions.I was offered by the recruiter to try again in 12 months, but I have no such intention, nor would I recommend it to talented people that I know.",

You will definitely need to code something within the interviews, but you can find about 75% of the coding challenges by clicking through the first ten pages of Google interview reports.Hints:- Think out loud.- Try to find out how much feedback the interviewer is willing to give by asking clarifying questions.- Prepare by doing some coding beforehand.- Start with a simple solution but mention that there might be better ones and think about them later.",

        "details": "I contacted Google through their website and applied for a software engineer in the Tel Aviv Office. There was an initial phone call with an HR recruiter (I think a day after I submitted my online application) - Just general questions about who I am and what I am looking for.After around 1 week I came to the on-site screening interview - 45 minutes of relatively simple graph questions -\u2026\u00a0 DFS/BFS stuff, and maybe a bit more complex questions regarding binary trees, but nothing too special. The interviewer told me I did well, but that I should be a bit more careful about the aesthetics of the code.2 weeks later I came to my whole day interview session - There were 6 interviews - I would say 3 which were more algorithmic, 1 which was almost pure coding, and 2 which were \"design\".The design interviews I remember -1) Design an online battlefield game - What would be the protocols between the server and the client, the algorithms and game flow to decide the state of the game, some basic networking (which I struggled with).2) How would you design Google images? The premise was that I should be able to search regarding specific features, for example the blue content, or images that are in pages that contain specific keywords. This was a very open-ended question, we thought \"together\" about solutions, what will be the size of my data which maps words to images, where would I store the images, how many servers I would need, etc... I had no previous experience in large scale design - The interviewer said that it wasn't expected of me. I thought I did relatively well, but I guess they ARE looking for people with previous experience in large scale design, from the input I got later on.Algorithmic interviews I remember -1) How would you design an efficient algorithm to find out in a sorted array which number appears the most times. I started from the simple solution, and continued to a more complex one ( with some hints along the way from the interviewer) that in summary does a binary search of the number of times the most frequent number appear - (think about it - I have an array of size N, if the most frequent number appears N/2 times, then I can infer this just from sampling the values at indexes (0,N/4,N/2,N*3/4,N). I thought I did well in that interview.2) Write code that prints the Cartesian product (row by row for each combination) of a given list of lists (that contain integers). Since you don't know from beforehand how many lists there are, you obviously can't just hard-code lots of for loops. During the interview I gave two solutions - A recursive one, and after writing it out, they asked me to also write a non-recursive one - Which I did with a counter which maps each times to a different combination of values (with some mod mathematics).I think I also did well in that interview.There was a lunch break where it was obvious they simply told someone that today \"you have to eat lunch with a candidate\". It was a bit awkward at first, but it did give me a chance to interrogate him about how it is to work in Google. The food was extra yummy.After one week I got a response that I didn't pass the interview process. The guy stressed that I was \"Close\", that I did really good on 2 interviews and a bit less good on the other 4. Oh well.My preparation to the interview consisted of doing all the regular algorithmic/coding questions - I think that did prepare me well to the relevant interviews. But there was no real preparation to the more general \"System Design\" interviews - I think it's a bit more difficult to prepare for those, but I guess I still would have invested in that more time, retrospectively. Otherwise - I thought I did pretty well in the interview day - I guess that they can be REALLY picky about taking people who really did perfect in each and every interview. Just for reference I had an interview day at Facebook a few days later - I thought I did much better at the Google interview day, but ended getting an offer from Facebook and not Google. I guess also some luck doesn't hurt.The responsive of the hiring recruiter was always prompt. He was very nice, though at times it was a bit ridiculous - telling me again and again to call him If I have any problems, even if it's during the weekend or late at night. I mean it was nice to have a sponsor that \"cares for me\" during the process, but there's no need to push it...",

The first call :I applied online when I saw the position opening of software engineer in Taipei on Mar 2014. After about 1 month, I received a call from a Google recruiter. He asked me about mt preference of working location since there are some other openings in Hong Kong and China. I told him I preferred working in Taiwan and then he told me he would transfer my resume to Google Taipei but I need to wait since they were very busy.2. The email from Google Taipei :On May 21, when I was about to give up, I got an email from Google HR and then we discussed the time that she could call me through email. On May 27, she called me and asked some questions about my resume, including my experience, why did I want to work for Google, was there any other competing offer, and lastly did I have any question. Also she explained the whole hiring process to me. It was easy and relaxed. The HR was very nice and no difficult questions once your resume only includes the fact. At the end, I asked her if I could postpone the phone interview until I finished my master oral defense which is around the end of June. She said it was totally fine and she would contact me in another two weeks.3.An email about how to prepare the interview :Right after we ended the conversation, I got an email from the HR. The email includes a lot of information, such as how to prepare for Google technical interview, which books are recommended to read, some preparation tips, videos. I borrowed the book \"Programming Pearl\" and \"Cracking the Coding Interview\" to read. Also I constantly practiced coding on the website \"leetcode\". I kept practicing and had waited for a long time. On July 7, I sent her an email to make sure that I still had the chance to interview.

I think he cares does the project relate to internet or cloud application, but unfortunately I did not involve too much.After that he asked me two technical\u2026\u00a0 questions. I'm not allowed to expose the detail about the technical questions as the HR mentioned in the email. The first question is to write a code on a Google Doc that we shared. It was not too difficult. I think everyone can do it well as long as he(she) has practiced to write codes and review basic algorithms and data structures. Though I was too nervous and made some mistake and said a lot of nonsense. After I finished most part, he asked me could I further optimize it. I didn't figure out any but just during the time I guessed around he pointed out the way he thought.The second question was an open question. I told him my approach and he asked for more detail. And he pointed out the disadvantage about my approach. And after that he asked is there any other approach in my mind. I tried hard to think about another and he also discussed with me the trade off of. During the whole process, the interviewer was silent and made me thought that the phone was disconnect(my cell phone does that many times). I think maybe he was waiting for me to say more, discuss more or some better answers. Too bad I was really nervous and couldn't think too much. \u00a0"

The next stage would have been on-site interviews at the Google Campus. 4 technical interviews + 1 interview during a free lunch.Most important knowledge for the technical interviews:- understanding of complexity theory- algorithms (TSP, shortes path, etc) [also their complexity]- data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs) [also their complexity for searching, traversing etc]",

She presented a graph problem which I considered my speciality. It had one tweak which she explained very badly. I asked her to reexplain the\u2026\u00a0 tweak twice. Then I was like \"I understood it that way. So I'd do it this way. What do you think?\". She then told me to \"just implement it\". I implemented it very fast. In the meantime, she read my CV. When I concluded, she looked at the code (which was probably 15-20 LoC). She then noticed that the way I handled the tweak was different to what she said. So she was like: \"I told you to do it that way. What did you do there?\". While I felt a little offended because if she had put a little more effort in explaining it I would have gotten it right away. Her version would have been even easier to implement.",

You can describe the better solution during the discussion later.- If you don't see the solution, try to write down a few examples\u2026\u00a0 or corner cases. You can observe the solutions from these.- Although it's more than recommended to know a wide range of algorithms or data structures, you'll rarely use these during the actual coding.

The problem was trivial and easy, I asked him several times is there something special, like very long array, distribution of workload, etc., but he just somehow ignored me and pushed me to write code. He was asking me trivial things about my code and not about the solution.From the first 5 minutes I knew that the interview is over.

Know your data structures and algorithms back to front; be prepared for questions as high-level as very general OOP design problems and as low-level\u2026\u00a0 as bit manipulations; and know your resume cold, because every interviewer was interested in at least one item on it.I HIGHLY recommend finding a copy of at least one coding interview book (Cracking the Coding Interview, Programming Interviews Exposed, and Design & Analysis of Algorithms served me well) and tackling the problems in it -- they will give you a good idea of what to expect. I will say that I had never seen any of the questions I was asked in my Google interviews (whereas the rest of the industry seems to recycle the same 20 questions over and over), but my practice with general interview-style coding questions was extremely useful nonetheless.Remember that the interviewer wants to see how you approach a problem you haven't necessarily seen before, so think out loud a lot, and don't forget your edge cases! \u00a0"

Apparently, Google claims that they look at the candidate's thought process, it's wasn't so in my case! I got 2 questions partially correct\u2026\u00a0 and *I think* I did well in all others in 5 interviews and still got rejected. The feedback from the recruiter was that a \"a couple of interviews went well but a couple others didn't go so well\"Insider story is that every interviewer gives you a score1- no hire2- no hire, but unsure3- hire, but unsure4- hireYou must get an average score > 3.5 for the local hiring committee to approve your application. I think mine got scraped at the local level itself.Overall, the interview experience was positive. I had a couple of easy phone screens and they provided to and fro tickets to Bangalore, accommodation and local transport. The pace of the interviews was comfortable, there was free lunch and everyone was on time.My recruiter was very unprofessional. She didn't get back to me until 1.5 months after the interview was done. I must have sent her 6 follow up emails and she didn't bother responding to any one of them. A short note asking me to wait for some more time would have been very helpful. A rule of thumb is if the recruiter isn't calling back and checking up if you have an offer at hand etc., they are not that interested in you.Note that references from engineers working in Google matter a lot. Google also does a background check if you have peers inside and you cannot lie - I was asked if I had worked with certain people already in the company. I had a nasty ex-colleague in Google who because of team dynamics was pitched as my competition (I know, petty politics!). If you have such a case, don't write his/her name.

I had mine done over two consecutive days, they are flexible if you ask. I forget how the times worked, but I remember them not being allowed to run over more than a minute even. It was a hard-cutoff time and they'd leave the room. Don't be dismayed by that, but be sure to finish what you need to on the whiteboard in time.Most interviewers were friendly and personable. One was extremely arrogant who seemed to gain pleasure from proving your \"stupidity\" to himself. Everyone I spoke to carries a chip on their shoulder that they work there, even if they're just a couple years out of school and have never had a \"real job\" as they call it.My self evaluation after the interview was that I had gotten 4 of the 5 well, and made a mistake that led me not to get the solution in time for one of them, though got most of the way through. I fudged the time complexity evaluation on one of the complex problems, but got the solution.After a week wait, I didn't get an offer. The HR person was nice, and on request acknowledged only one mistake noted in the interview process, that I was aware of. She said everyone liked me and several had said they would like me on their respective team (I guess that is part of their review process). She was unable to provide any more info.

Had a phone interview then on-site. The on-site was 5 separate interviews plus lunch.The process is pretty long, though the turnaround between phone interview and on-site was quicker than other steps. One of the flaws of the process is that they don't have things together... the phone\u2026\u00a0 interviewer didn't know if I'd been notified about the phone interview (he hadn't when he interviewed) and so we didn't use Google Docs for coding - just more general questions. Something like 3 of my on-site interviewers were replaced last-minute, room confusion, lateness, etc. Follow-up with recruiter tended to be a day after it was supposed to be.The coding questions are much like you've seen on this site and others. There was a focus on tough general algorithms questions. I understand that they like to use variations on actual problems they've encountered, but they seemed to be (mostly) artifacts from such a heavy focus on distributed computing. I don't get to do distributed computing in my normal duties, so I was unprepared. The other downside is that there seemed to be too much focus on computational complexity and not as much on readability, maintainability, development time constraints.The hardest part is that placement doesn't happen until the time of the offer. So you don't know if you'll actually want to go until you're really invested in it.My advice for interviewers: Work on hard graduate-level algorithms problems to prepare, slight focus to the weird sorts of things you have to do for distributed programming. If the interviewer is asking you a design question, make sure they clarify what they're actually for.My advice for Google: Try to mesh the questions with the candidate's background better. Give more clear in-interview feedback about whether the solution is adequate, how it could be better. Allow for more time for the candidate to ask questions. There's no downtime at all for almost 6 hours, so maybe an easy question after lunch? Give more detailed feedback about specific weaknesses. Spend some time convincing the candidate that this is a good fit for their experience (or not) - without a job description you don't even know if it's interesting or not.All this sounds very negative but you can really feel the excitement on Google campus.",

However, he DEMANDED (seriously) that I implement it in valid C++ syntax. Ok, fine - I did my best, but there were some syntax errors because it has been at least 6 months since I've done extensive C++ programming.He spent so much time nit-picking over my brackets, etc...I was ready to scream! We burned up the entire 45 minute phone call on this one problem. I did squeeze in a question or two at the end, but that was it. I never got a chance to discuss my background, ask him extensive questions about Google - nothing.I'm not an idiot. I am young, but I have a Master's degree and a Bachelor's degree in computer science. I have a security clearance and currently work on the design of safety-critical distributed software systems.

        "details": "I got an initial indication of interest e-mail from a recruiter at Google who had my resume on file from a while back. He asked me a couple standard non-technical questions, and then set up a phone interview.My phone interview consisted of a couple sanity checks (e.g. \"What does static mean in C++?\") followed by one very tough technical question which lasted the entire interview.That went well, so they brought\u2026\u00a0 me onsite, where I had 5 technical interviews, all 45 minutes each. They always seemed to run up to the limit/a couple minutes over, I think they should consider making the time longer. In the middle of the day I had lunch with an engineer for an hour who fielded whatever questions I had, but they don't provide feedback, so feel free to ask anything.Each interview pretty much followed the same format -- they presented the question, asked me to go, I would say something like \"Well the naive way to do it is ___, but let's look for the better way\", but they would ask me to code the naive way anyway (usually). Then they would ask me how inefficient it is, how to improve it, and then ask me to code that. They wanted code (or pseudo code, if there were only a couple minutes left) in almost all situations -- they write it all down or just take a picture. At the end, each one turns it around to see if you have any questions for them.My recruiter gave me status updates along the way, letting know what my status was, and it took about 3 weeks to hear back.People: a couple interviewers seemed grumpy, like they didn't want to be there -- I didn't like that. But everybody, including the grumps, were really excited about their job, and really liked all their benefits/perks/freedom/situation in general.Advice: the interviews are tough! Expect at least a couple months to review if you're rusty; study lots of books like CLRS; do a **lot** of practice problems (TopCoder is a very good resource); practice problems on the white board (I found this especially useful); bring in your own skinny white board markers -- the ones in the interview rooms are fat and hard to write with; be prepared to talk through your solution; bring several questions for all the interviewers (even just \"how do you like your job?\"); for things like quicksort/mergesort/merge/binary search, you should be able to write that in your sleep while you're drunk.

        "details": "So a Google recruiter calls me and I get all excited. I'm fairly happy with my current employer, but, after all, it's Google. I talk to the recruiter and we discuss a few things like where I would like to work, etc. I ask them:- \"Are you looking for any particular background - web, databases, storage, networking?\"- \"Oh, no no, we're just looking for generally smart people.\"Ok fair enough. Recruiter\u2026\u00a0 1 hands me off to Recruiter 2. Recruiter 2 then hands me off to Recruiter 3 who's, finally, local to my area. Cool.Step 1: Phone interview. I talk to a \"person who is around my level\". They ask me to write some code using Google Docs. Pretty easy.Step 2: Round 1. Two one-hour sessions. Both times I'm given some code printouts (in language of my choice) and asked deeply technical questions. The first hour is in the form of \"this code does not work, why? Ok you found a bug, fix it. Ok now when we run this, it does this, why?\"... and so forth. The second hour, there's a lot more code and two interviewers at once. I was told that one of them is a \"junior interviewer\". The problem is, they interrupt each other asking questions as I'm trying to solve things on the board. As I try to explain a solution to interviewer 1, interviewer 2 randomly jumps in: \"so what do you think the running time is?\" Nice way to stress one out... At the end of that, they tell me it's ok to be a little stressed out.Step 3: Round 2. Three one-hour sessions. Now, each time, I am not given much and asked to write code on the board. I felt like I did OK with interviewers 1 and 2 but interviewer 3 was very difficult to communicate with. He would describe a board game puzzle in a very silent manner and then not really ask a question. Several times I had to ask him \"uhh, I guess you would like me to write a function that does XYZ?\" And then get a very subtle nod back. I wrote some stuff but couldn't tell if he was impressed, indifferent, or expected something else completely. In any case, I feel like that was the part I blew.Note that at no point were my experience, past employment accomplishments, management skills, personality, interests, or career goals ever discussed.Step 4: Wait for two weeks. After a week I emailed the recruiter and the response was \"Sorry, one of the people who interviewed you had not submitted their feedback yet\". I showed that to some very senior developers in my network who laughed and said \"dude, that's a good sign that the organization is slowly rotting\".Step 5: Get rejection voicemail. The reason being that I'm \"not quite the right fit for the engineering roles we have open\". Fair enough. \"We're generally looking for smart people\" came to mind. Thanks a lot Google! :)Step 6: Two weeks later get a phone call from Google Recruiter 4 who wants to talk to me about employment opportunities at Google! No joke! I told her I'm not \"generally smart\".",

The first interview, I was asked how to implement a drawLine() function. And also asked how I would create test cases ( TDD ). Second interview I was asked how to find a particular record with a given date out of a set of records. Third interview I was asked a really obscure problem which I can't remember. Fourth interview was about how to implement queue behaviour with 2 stacks. Fifth interview was an algorithm for string operations.

Once again, I really liked me interviewer. He asked me some higher-level algorithmic questions, with a bit of an AI bent to the them. Interesting stuff. It was interesting stuff, and I eventually came to the solutions he was looking for, but it took some prompting.In the end, I wasn't invited to a second round of interviews and I wasn't particularly surprised by this.

        "details": "Applied online and was contacted by a recruiter a week later. Had a phone interview the next week, where the interviewer asked a little bit about my past experience, a few language specific questions, programming concepts/data structures and then gave me a coding assignment to mail back in an hour.Received feedback within a few days that they wanted to bring me onsite for an interview, but that was around the\u2026\u00a0 holidays, so we didn't schedule anything until after the holiday season. I prepared for the interview by going over the links they provided (topcoder.com, etc) and dug up my old college course notes. When I got there, I had 5 interviews and a lunch. Had to write code for all of the interviews, but the final interview was more high level and pseudocode was allowed. (The other interviews all required syntactically correct code). The interviews all took the same form - asked a little about something on my resume, a code question, analysis of your solution (big-O, etc) and a design-type question. There were no brain-teasers or trivia questions.The one thing I did not like about the interviews - but am not at all surprised at - is that they aren't too interested in selling you on the company or helping you find out what working there would be like. None of the interviewers bothered to tell me what they did, what group they worked for or what their title was. I barely had time to ask any questions and almost felt like it wasn't important to some of them to leave room for me to ask questions. I ended up asking the recruiter all the questions after the interviews were over.The recruiter kept me informed throughout the process when my application passed from hiring committee to executive hiring committee. The total turnaround time from onsite interview to offer was less than 2 weeks - which doesn't sound as long as some of the other experiences posted.Advice to anyone interviewing: know your stuff. If you don't have a solid knowledge of fundamentals - start studying. If you don't know how to analyze the running time of your algorithm - go learn. If you don't have experience coding - practice.",

Both of these first two interviewers took me through the standard Google \"write a search routine\" and \"describe how you would approach this sampling from a massive data set problem\".The third in-person interviewer was just strange. First, he clearly was distracted from the interview process and felt put out by having to interview someone.\u2026\u00a0 He went through the motions of the standard type of \"write some code to solve this problem\" question. But any time I asked a question to clarify some part of the problem statement he grunted and glanced around the room wildly before stating that it was obvious. Once the hour was up, the interviewer stood up abruptly and said \"I have to go\" and left the room.With no instructions as a candidate I had to run after the interviewer to catch him outside the building to ask what happens next. To which he shrugged and said \"Go home or go find HR.\" With no further information I decide that this wasn't a culture I was willing to work in.",
