The voice quality was horrible; the interviewer probably used a laptop to call, because all I can hear was lots of echo\u2026\u00a0 and the voice kept breaking up too. English is not my mother language; through out the whole one hour of interview, I had a very difficult time understanding his words and thinking at the same time.The bad communication probably went both way; 5 minutes after I already described and even noted down the tradeoffs in terms of complexities and worst scenario of one solution, the interviewer asked me the time complexity. When I asked if I should go down one way of solving the problem, he said no, but eventually (at the very last second of the interview) I realized that was actually the way. I can only conclude that the interviewer either couldn't understand/hear me, or didn't know the thinking process of getting to the final solution he wanted.Overall this was my worst phone interview experience.",

The day began at 10am. There were 3 coding interviews, 1 interview about my projects and leadership roles, and a demo of one of their new beta products was also shown. Each of the interviews were 1 hour long and had some moderately challenging questions. Note that the HR person insisted that there would be emphasis on concurrency related questions and I prepped especially for that. But, alas, there were none, which surprised her. The day on site ended at 4pm.I got an email notification the next week, in about 3 business days, that I was unfortunately not a good match for them and they noted that with more experience I should be a better match, so I appreciate that clarity in feedback. Overall, my experience was really good and the interviews were fair and relatively easy. I think given that Dropbox is a new and fairly small company, they need excellent candidates and looks like if you are not perfect, you may not be hired even if you are pretty good, as they probably need the best folks to take the company forward.
