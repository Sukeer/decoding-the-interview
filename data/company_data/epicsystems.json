The phone call was about\u2026\u00a0 30 mins.The next stage is the assessment. This can be done online from your computer or you can go to a location to be proctored. If you take it on your computer, you will need to use a proctoring program. The program captures your screen. They require you to have a webcam and microphone as well. If you cannot do this like me, they set you up with a proctoring location and you will take the test there on a computer. The assessment has 2 phases, a multiple choice section which is logic questions and a section that requires you to write code to solve 4 different problems. The code can be written in C/C++, Java, Python, and some other languages. There is a list to choose from. The test will take about 2-3 hours.I have started the final interview yet.",

The questions themselves were very simple, so I'm not sure what exactly\u2026\u00a0 they were hoping to learn from it.Finally I was flown in onsite and treated lavishly, put up in a really nice hotel and given 2 fancy dinners in Madison (one the night of arrival and one the night after the interview), one with a technical problem solver and another with a developer. The interview day itself didn't really feel like too much of an interview for me. I basically just got to talk to a bunch of different developers, had a nice free lunch, and got a tour of the huge/nerdy campus. The only real interview questions I got were a few behavior ones from the HR person at the end, and even those just seemed like part of a conversation more than anything else.",

They just chat, ask about your major, a project you've worked out, etc. Nothing to worry about.2) Exam. This is the hardest part. It's a two part exam electronically proctored exam, one containing a general 20 question exam measuring learning aptitude. All epic applicants have to take this, regardless\u2026\u00a0 of position. They give you a dummy (weird) programming language and teach it to you, and then have you answer questions about it as you go. The second part, for programming applicants only, is just 4 interview-style programming questions that you type up in the language of your choice. This part required more mental stamina for me, so I would do this first and the other second, as you get to choose which to take first. I did not enjoy this part. This is also the part where most applicants seem to be weeded out.3) On-site interview. This part was great. They fly you out to Madison, put you in a hotel for the night, have an employee take you to dinner and ask all the questions you want. The next day is the actual interview day where they take you on a tour around campus, have a session where they show you around their software, have you meet individually with a former intern, and feed you lunch. Very, very impressive, engaging campus. Lots of opportunities to ask questions. There are two interviews, one with an engineer who will discuss one of the projects you've done for a half hour or so, and then one with an HR representative who asks typically behavioral questions. Most people on glassdoor say the on-site interview is easy and that you're basically guaranteed the position if you make it there, but I was not given an offer, so either that's not true or I did something wrong that I can't identify.",

        "details": "Applied at my university's career fair. I received an email to set up a phone interview. The phone interview was very relaxed and the engineer was easy to talk to. Basically just asked why I want to work at Epic and about projects I've worked on professionally, but none of the big projects I've done on the side.Within 15 minutes of the phone interview I received an email to take\u2026\u00a0 their programming assessment.I took the test the next day as there was no way to study for it. They used an online proctor program with webcam / microphone monitoring. In the first section they teach you about a new language and test you on it. This part can be tricky because their tutorial is not very specific and some of the questions were very much debatable. Unfortunately you don't get that opportunity, so pick wisely.The next part of the test took me a little over 2 hours. It was 4 programming questions in a row and you are not allowed to use the bathroom (or do anything for that matter) because these questions are all in one section. Definitely keep that in mind when moving on with this section, as it made it very hard for me to focus towards the end and I could've done better if it weren't for this limitation. Nevertheless, I know I did fine in this section, but probably not as well as they wanted.Though I did get rejected, I gave this interview experience a thumbs down because:1) Even companies like Google understand that Java APIs and syntactical questions are online and it is impractical to test someone on how well they know a specific API. Epic seems to be especially different here, but that is my opinion.2) The proctor set up was a little overboard.3) Though I've been employed in development for years, I'm disappointed that the projects I've done in my free time meant little to nothing to them, though many of them were on my resume, I put a lot of time into them, they are online, and they did not try them out (I checked!). This is an application for an internship, not a full-time position. Let's be realistic here. Some of the most dedicated students are staying are spending their weekend nights and playing with technologies and building projects that are meaningful to them. I feel that you can learn a lot about a person from that.I emailed them for feedback to improve on myself but have yet to receive a response.If Epic is the only place you want to work my advice is to only on algorithms and data structures.",

You should be ready to discuss everything on your resume and you should have some good stories to tell about your projects... Took the ProctorU test a few days later. The test was divided in two parts. The first part covered questions, about 20 of them, of a made-up language. Some were really easy, others required more thinking; all in all don't necessarily go with your fits instinct. The second part had 4 programming questions where pseudocode could be used. In hindsight the programming questions were quite doable and exactly like the questions posted for Epic interviews here, on career cup and all other forums.

I was interviewed for software Developer position at Madison last week. Immediately after one day, I got a phone call where my recruiter said that they were moving forward with other candidates. I am still confused what actually went wrong from my side.There were\u2026\u00a0 two dinners with Epic developer as hosts during this process. The hosts were really nice persons. There were couple of other candidates along with me interviewing for same position. In whole group, I was the only non-American. Most of the time they were talking about mostly American things- the sports, the lifestyle, etc. I hardly understood what they were talking. Most of the time, I was just putting fake smile on my face. I just request to the future hosts - please talk about something which everyone in the group can understand. My another bad luck - I had never gone to such a restaurant before. I guessed and ordered the food. I couldn't eat even half of it. The host saw it and seemed very unhappy about it. I don't know if the discussions with dinner hosts count in the hiring decision.On the D-day, there were presentations about the tools Epic has developed. Also a lunch session with a developer. These discussions went really well. I asked few questions, they promptly answered. There were three main interviews.The technical presentation interview was very bad experience. The interviewer did not seem to be interested in the interview. Over the 45 minutes, he didn't even smile once. I was giving presentation about my favorite project and was very enthusiastic about it. But the interviewer wasn't just interested. He looked bit tensed since the beginning and carried the same expression throughout the interview. . He asked couple of simple questions - just for the sake of formality. I was thinking what should I do so that he would be happy about my interview. A request to Epic - if someone is not interested in conducting the interview, please don't force them.Even when the the second technical interview (case study) started, I was still thinking about the previous interview. I thought I was losing my opportunity, but I somehow recovered. This guy was a nice one, very friendly. We discussed about a problem and I had to write the code. This interview went fine. Actually towards the end he said that he was expecting a different approach to the code than mine, but overall I convinced him about my overall logic and procedure.The HR interview went really well. Jeff was very friendly. After general discussion (Madison city, the interview experience, desired compensation, etc.), he asked me where could Epic improve. I mentioned few things and he seemed very happy.Overall, all the people (except the first technical interviewer) were nice. For future candidates, I will just say - Apart from technical preparation, please also pray for luck to be on your side. If your interviewer is not interested in the interview, you can't just do anything.I was really interested in working at Epic. I am still not sure what exactly was the reason for my rejection.",

(Questions are given below)Before the test I had asked if there is a time limit and I was told no, but when I was doing my last question I got a pop up window saying, \"you have last 15 minutes before this test ends\".

Generally a pretty casual talk.Shortly after that I was an online assessment.

The math\u2026\u00a0 sections where basic algebra questions, the unlimited time one focusing more on reading comprehension with a couple of riddle questions. The basic programming section requires no previous coding experience, mostly just logic questions. The open-ended questions ask you to write some functions to solve a particular problem.After the online assessment was the on-site interview. For this they brought me in the day before the actual interview and a software developer took me out to dinner with a few other candidates. The dinner was casual and mostly an opportunity for us to ask about the company and the Madison area in general. The next day was the rest of the interview. This started with a talk from a software developer giving basic introduction to the company and the software they work on. Following that was a casual conversation with a software developer about what specifically they work on, life at Epic, and any questions we might have about the position. After that was a one on one case study with a software developer where they ask you to talk through a problem with them to a solution. They are looking at your thought process and problem solving skills here. This was followed with an informal lunch with a software developer and a tour of the campus. Then there was one on one interview with another developer in which you are asked to talk about a project. This is not a formal presentation, but meant to be more of a conversation. They will ask you questions about why you made certain choices and what you would do differently if you did it again, etc... Finally the day wrapped-up with an interview with the HR contact.",

This exam takes around 2 to 3 hours. Faster is better for epic.I think, if you have good grades then they will sure take you to interview process. Online assessment is very demanding and only factor that tests your ability. So, before applying, you can prepare all questions from careercup as after application we don't get enough time to prepare. Though in phone interview they say online assessment is just to test coding skills on arrays and string and they won't test tough algorithm, we should focus on best solution/algorithm to solve coding problem.

The second part of the interview process includes the epic exam. I thought like most of the questions in the exam don't fit what a software developer really do need. It\u2026\u00a0 covered quite a big scope. I would suggest they give a material for the applicant to learn and then test them with it. Not everybody can prove themself in an online test it truly depends on too many factors such as time taken, emotion at the time and state of mind. I would suggest also testing then through a technical skype interview to really get a feel of the candidate rather than tagging them with a test score.",

The programming questions were general(2 related to backtracking and 1 for recursive approach). About 2 weeks later, I was called in for onsite interview. Once you can get a onsite call, chance I guess are between 60% to 80% to convert into offer. There were 3 interviews(besides some presentations by company employees). 1st was project presentation round. Choose a project which you did good in and can present some figures in end(Mine had some figues because I did a simulation). 2nd interview was a case study. They discussed a general case that developer had during his work in Epic. He checked how astutely I could store data(using basic DS) and come up with some good observations. 3rd was with HR(behavioural interview).

From there, took a preliminary 30 minute interview with a software developer (not an HR guy) reviewing my past work and answering my questions about Epic.Proctored online test after that with a timed IQ test-style part, a brainteaser part, another to test how quick you can\u2026\u00a0 pick up a new programming language, and another that asks you to program a small function in a language of your choice.Didn't hear back for a while so I assumed I'd been turned down. News came in November 2014 that they wanted to fly me out for a day-long interview. They were very generous: they put us up in a Hilton in Madison, covered all cost of travel and food, and invited us to dinner with real Epic employees. (Tip: try the local specialties, like beer-battered cheese curds, and explore UW's campus.)Since the technical interview had already been taken care of online, the time spent on-site was mostly (I presume) used to gauge whether we meshed with the company culture and to show us what the workplace is like. They started with an overview of Epic's software suite (which was sorely needed--the website isn't very helpful for that), then had us break into small groups for Q&A with an employee.My rough patch was here. We were put one-on-one with a developer in a room with a whiteboard and asked to explain a project we'd worked on. I personally had only a very minor project to present, and my interviewer didn't seem too impressed when I finished before even half of my time had passed. I spent the rest of the session asking her questions about her job.Then we were taken to lunch in the cafeteria. Epic brings in gourmet chefs from Madison to do lunch and subsidizes the meals to about wholesale levels--big points scored there for me since I love food.The day ended with a tour of campus and Epic's peculiar workspaces. A few notable characteristics: (1) No cubicles. People are put in small groups in \"real rooms\". (2) Buildings have themes. We were shown the D&D/castle building, the NYC building, the Nordic building, and the newly-finished barn building. (3) Almost all software developers work on this campus to facilitate cooperation. (4) The Verona office is almost entirely off the grid, being powered by geothermal, solar, and wind energy.Received a call 2 weeks later saying they're extending an offer. As others have noted, a relocation stipend is available, as is prearranged housing. (Though you can choose to take that money and arrange your own housing.)",

        "details": "The application process was very streamlined and Epic HR are very good about maintaining communication. There are three stages: Phone Interview, Online Skills Assessment, and On-Site Interview.Phone Interview: The first part of the application process. Basically a ~30minute phone call with an Epic engineer talking about some of your previous experience, some code you've worked on and projects you've done, and interest in Epic.Skills Assessment: ~3 hour online skills assessment\u2026\u00a0 in which your mathematical and programming skills are tested. The test is proctored digitally so that you may only use what you already know, and any code written (any language) must be from your head and not from API or online code examples. The programming, which is by far the hardest section (math was very SAT-like, straightforward), has 4 open ended programming assignments that must be completed. Several of the questions had to do with string manipulation. Very little data structures knowledge was needed to complete the assessment, though recursion was useful.On-Site: Epic flies you out, dines you, and gives you a tour of the (incredible) campus. Most parts of the on-site interview are pretty stress-free, a lot of it involves speaking with various employees and engineers. Two \"tests\" of the interview include a 30 minute presentation of a previous project you've worked on to an engineer as well as answering some of his questions, as well as a short HR oriented talk.",

        "details": "I applied online. Eventually I was emailed for a phone interview as well as a skills assessment. The phone interview was with a software developer. It was a pretty informal interview, and he was mainly concerned with what experience I had and what projects I had done. Then I took the skills assessment, which sucked. It took about three hours, and by the end I was like I don't even\u2026\u00a0 care if I get the job at this point. I had to buy a webcam and install software which allowed ProctorU to monitor me and remotely control my computer. The skills assessment was a lot of IQ test type questions, plus learning a made-up language (pretty easy), followed by 3 or 4 moderately difficult string manipulation programming questions. I wrote them in Java and I remember doing a lot of switch statements. Apparently I did okay on the skills assessment, because I received an email saying they wanted to fly me to their headquarters. I flew in the day before, and had dinner with an Epic employee. Some other interviewees came as well. She had already decided where we were going. She paid for it though, which was nice. I should mention that the meals with employees were by far the most awkward parts of the whole interview experience. I had three meals with Epic employees, and it was obvious that 2 of the 3 people I ate with were just doing it to get a free meal. They had no interest in talking with interviewees. I suggest skipping one or both of the dinners so that you can find a place that you actually want to eat, plus you won't have to make small talk with someone who doesn't want to talk to you. Epic put me up in the Hilton Monona. They give you breakfast vouchers, and will pay for room service, which I suggest you take advantage of. I did. The only things they don't cover are booze and pay-per-view. I had my day of interviews start bright and early at like 8:30 AM. It was all over by about 1 or 2 PM. I rode in a cab with about 5 other interviewees. We all went to a little room where they had some food set out for breakfast. There are food and drinks everywhere. We had to eat and make small talk with HR until a software developer came in and gave us his spiel about Epic software. They also gave us folders that described some of the past intern projects, which all sounded interesting. Then I and two other intern interviewees broke off in a group and spoke to an employee who had done the intern program. This wasn't really an interview, just a chance to ask questions. He was wearing jeans and a zip up hoodie and had earrings in.I suggest you wear something to the interview that isn't too casual, even though you could get away with it. A polo and nice jeans with running shoes would be the minimum. Almost all of the other interviewees, including myself, were wearing a button-up shirt beneath a sweater.Then I had my software developer interview followed by my HR interview. The software dev interview was pretty casual. I told him about my project, he asked a few questions about what design choices I had made, describe the project, would you change anything, etc. Definitely practice giving an overview of your project. I didn't demo the project or give an actual presentation, we just sat in an empty room and talked. There were no technical questions. He talked about his job a lot, and I asked a lot of questions. The HR interview was pretty relaxed. She asked about my experience, what is one good and bad thing each reference would say about me, what is one misconception people have about me. She was pretty nice though. Then I and the other 2 interviewees had lunch with a software developer. It was painfully obvious he didn't want to speak to us. The food wasn't as good as they made it out to be. He gave us a brief tour afterward. I noticed that almost everyone I passed was in there 20s, a sign of high turnover. Nobody I talked to seemed to think work-life balance was a concern, even though people on Glassdoor seemed to think otherwise. Then we got another tour from a different guy, but this time it was more in-depth. The campus was really massive and elaborate. Then we took a cab back to the hotel, and I just relaxed until dinner time. Overall, I was very impressed with Epic. In the morning, I took the hotel shuttle to the airport and flew home. 14 days later, I received a call from the HR lady saying they were moving forward with other candidates. Don't assume that you have the job locked in just because they fly you out there, even though it's an internship! As you can imagine, I'm pretty disappointed, considering the amount of time I put in. I must have said something during the interview that turned them off.",

The phone interview was very easy about 30 minutes, a software developer asked couple of questions about projects I have worked on, asked questions such as how did u handle this case and this case etc.Second,I had an online assessment test. I would not say the\u2026\u00a0 test was easy, but not that hard. If you know how to program, and if you think as an computer science major student you will be able to crack the questions especially programming part. Personally, I did not find the programming questions that hard. After two days, I received en email saying they invite me to an onsite interview.Finally,the on site interview for interns is just tour of the campus.When I went there the weather was very cold , and could not see much of the campus's beauty.The morning of the interview day started with couple of software demo presentations,you can ask questions if you want but I think it is not required. After that, you will talk to a software developer, and present your a project you have worked on.The software developer was such a young guy with 3-4 years of experience, I presented my project in 20 mins and he did not ask any questions about my project at all. The required time was 45 min, and he was always looking at a watch and randomly started talking about the company and staff. Next, you will have an interview with HR where she or he will ask behavioral questions.In my case, I had an HR who graduated a college maybe 2-3 years ago. We had a talk about a team work,a little bit about projects and she asked question such as why epic,do you require a visa sponsorship etc.After 2 weeks, I received a phone call saying that they decided to go with other candidates. The reason for the rejection is still mystery to me. Btw, I have a good GPA,a past internship experience and bunch of android IOS application experiences.Also, I am studying in one of the big ten universities. Only thing that is unusual is I am an international student.I do not know how they evaluate candidates. Also, it took me two month entire process because I could not find time for each round of the inverview,and had each round after 2-3 weeks.Thanks.",

The person that interviewing me was a software developer himself, as well as a team lead.

This is a long, multi-part online exam that tests your math, logic, and programming skills. The exam was proctored, so someone was watching me through my webcam. The exam lasted over 3 hours for me, and I was definitely underprepared for programming part. If you are a CS major, you will have to solve algorithm problems, and implement the solutions in a real language, e.g. Java.

First there was a basic phone interview where they ask you about your background and your interests, and you can ask them about their company and the job you are applying for. A couple of days later they had me take a proctored online skills test, which consisted of math/logic, puzzles, a section where\u2026\u00a0 they teach you a language and then ask you questions about it, and 4 programming exercises. It was fairly challenging and took a couple hours to get through. Then there was the onsite interview where they give you a tour of the campus, and had a couple of interviews. These interviews included a peer programming exercise with one of their employees, a discussion of your past projects and experiences with programming, and a behavioral interview where they ask you your strengths and weeknesses and what others would say your strengths and weaknesses are. In the end I didn't end up with an offer, but it was still a good experience.",

I remember being asked a design question on creating a auto-complete feature for mobile phones.After clearing the phone-screen, the next step is the skills test. It had 4 sections.1. Speed (20 minutes) - questions are simple. Speed matters. Do not swell on any question for long. 10 questions in all as I remember2. programing questions based on a new language -\u2026\u00a0 This is fairly intuitive and simple3. Logic based puzzles- Most of the questions are repeated. Going through the list on glassdoor was really helpful4. Programming part - 4 questions in all. Not difficult, but once can be a little tricky. Going through the list of programs covered on Glassdoor/ careercup was really helpful. Most of the stuff gets repeated from a pool.-----and thats about it. Once you clear this, you get called for an onsite interview. Most of the onsite interview was interaction-based. Be attentive and ask pertinent questions wherever possible.Two main interviews happened at my onsite experience:1. Talk in depth about one of the projects you have worked on. So I ended up explaining my summer internship project, went well!2. A design-centric problem is given. I was asked to show how I would implement a dashboard which would allow monitoring of children < 5years who are supposed to receive polio vaccines. It had to be designed from the standpoint of the nurse, who would be using the system.Both interviews went well, so expecting to hear a positive reply from the Company.The experience was fabulous and the campus was exquisite! Extremely beautiful and creatively done. Also, the lunch was brilliant, thoroughly enjoyed it! :)",

After this, you'll talk about the culture at Epic, the benefits of working there (the guy I talked with emphasized the lack of cubicles and perks like the subsidized cafeteria), the typical software stack, and Madison, WI.The skills assessment is done on ProctorU. I had never taken a test using the service, but apparently it's common in certain universities for final exams and the like for online courses. When you're taking the test, you'll have another person monitoring you through a webcam looking for suspicious movement. Before the test starts, they will gain access to your computer and check your process list to close down any unnecessary programs (it irked me that they shut down Dropbox without even asking). They'll also ensure that your screen does not have any sticky notes on it, that your workspace is cleared, and so forth. They see your screen at all times. You're allowed a calculator and some scratch paper.The assessment consists of 4 parts, the first 3 are written about elsewhere (Glassdoor has annoying post limit which necessitated truncating this part).Final part is a four question programming test. This is pretty challenging; my biggest problem is that I often look at reference websites when writing code that uses standard libraries, and I had no such luxury for this test. As a result, much of what I wrote was pseudocode, as detailed as I could make it, and using real code when I could remember it. I also commented well and provide thoughts about time complexity and efficiency when appropriate. You can write in C, C++, Java, Python, etc. Javascript and other functional languages are unlisted if I recall correctly.You should have an excellent grasp on string manipulation and data structures (both standard and custom). I'd recommend working out some problems on Project Euler, as one question would resemble those sort of math-based programming challenges. I won't state the specific problems, since it is worth more to a programmer to prepare generally and to be able to solve these problems on the spot.They recommend to allow 2-3 hours to take the test, and this was pretty accurate for me. The first three sections fly by; I took 3 hours on the last section, however.It took five days for Epic to get back to me after the assessment. Along with selecting a date for the on-site interview, I had to also take a Rembrandt personality test which is short and easy.The on-site interview was actually the best part of the process. They covered my airfare and hotel room. You can choose to have dinner with some current employees and a few other candidates (Madison has excellent restaurants by the way, so I strongly recommend you do this!).I arrived at the Epic campus at 8 AM the next morning. There is software demo with a current developer, who will talk about their project, the impact Epic has in healthcare, and will answer any questions. This is in a group of about 8 candidates. This group splits off so that four candidates have a conversation with a project lead about working at Epic.After this, I met another developer and had an interview where I presented a project I had worked on and answered questions about implementation, challenges, etc.Following this was a case-study interview with yet another developer. They present a general problem to solve and you have to create the basic system to solve it. When you are doing this they are constantly asking questions about how your system will handle extreme/odd cases. This can get pretty stressful, I suppose, but any programmer should be able to prototype a system fairly quickly.The last person I met was my recruiter from HR who looked over my application, transcripts, and references, and asked me general questions like my strengths/weaknesses and what I was expecting in terms of salary, career growth, and so on. Be sure to know how much you are worth and ask accordingly!After this I had lunch, toured the campus, went home.I received an offer 1.5 weeks later. It is extremely competitive with other tech companies (the pay is basically equivalent to Google/Microsoft when considering the low cost of living in Madison) and with comprehensive benefits.",

Many other posters have already mentioned the layout so you can look for those posts elsewhere. As far\u2026\u00a0 as the programming portion is concerned, careercup has a lot of great examples. I would recommend running through problems on careercup to get a feel for the programming problem.The third stage was the on-site interview. The on-site interview consisted primarily of tours and Q&A sessions with different developers working on different projects. However there are two interview sessions: the first is a case study. The case study presents a problem that Epic may have encountered many years ago and your job is to figure out as best as possible how to implement a solution for that problem. The second interview session is basically a conversation between you and developer about a project you worked on. The developer will ask you a series of questions regarding how or why you chose to implement things the way you did. Both sessions are straight forward if you have a good understanding of how to tackle conceptual problems and a firm grasp of whatever project you worked on.Overall, one of the better interview processes I have had. EPIC has a lot of money which translates nicely when it comes to the interviewing process. Everything was taken for care for me as smoothly as possible.

The algorithm part has 4 questions, which is not very hard. You can write whatever language you like in a plain-text editor. You really can find a lot of questions here. I did read a lot but I didn't remember the answer so I did it by myself in the exam. But it's time-consuming. I'm not very good at math and logic. So if you really value this test, please do search. They don't set time limit, but you'd better finish that around 3 hours. Although I think they have wired picking standard (because all my super-technical smart classmates failed while me who is not so good at coding passed), the key to pass is to be careful and calm.The onsite interview is a very good experience. The campus is AWESOME! They even have a D&G building and some farm yard for employee to plant! All people there are very nice and helpful, trying to help you solve problem. The project presentation DO NOT require a slides. I did a very fancy PPT but didn't use. The engineer will ask you in detail about your project.

        "details": "I submitted my resume on their website, and was contacted a couple weeks later. They started with a first round of phone interview with one of their developers. He asked me basic questions, probably filling out a prescribed form by the companies. None of the questions were difficult or interesting at all, so I found it rather boring. In fact, the developer lacks the enthusiasm that I found in the\u2026\u00a0 people who interviewed me from other companies - he sounds bored and tired from the job. It's quite ironic that I didn't get a very good impression from the company, but I answered his questions in the most polite way anyway.Several days later, HR informed me that I had passed the first basic round, and they moved me forward to the assessment round. They booked an appointment for me at a proctor center, which was very convenient in my city. The assessment test consists of four parts: reasoning/logic, math, personality assessment and programming. As someone whose study covers a wide range of topics in CS, the assessment was rather boring for me. The questions were rather easy and in my opinion, can't reflect how good I will be as a developer. The programming questions were alright, but the framework they used lacks to many features for programming; I found it very frustrated from the lack of code-formatting support in the editor. The questions weren't particularly easy but weren't difficult either. And then there were personality assessment questions, which I found very boring. I finished the whole assessment in two and a half hours, and I think I answered the questions very well.Two or three days later, HR reached me again and informed me that they wanted to move me to the final round with an engineer and an HR staff member. This time, the engineer was better and he was enthusiastic about the company. He asked me some technical questions which I answered easily, and he also asked me some personality questions, too. After the call, an HR staff member called me again and she was very friendly and upbeat. She talks about life in Madison and answered many of my questions. I think the final round was better than the first phone call, but that doesn't convince me to like the technology the company uses any better.Two days after the interview, HR contacted me and informed me of my offer. The number was really good considering the low cost of living in Madison. I was swayed a bit, but I guess money wasn't enough to convince me to commit to VB6. A week later I received an offer from a big company (one of the biggest names in Silicon Valley) so I walked away from Epic offer.Overall, it was an okay experience. Their HR was very quick to response to my inquires so I consider that a bonus point for their hiring process. But I think they can use some improvement in the way they hire developers. Also, if they don't move away from VB6 quickly, many people will be dissuaded from joining the company like me.",

Maybe my qualifications were a bit less then, considering I'm an Electrical Engineering major with a minor in Computer Science.But to my surprise, after almost an year, they send me an email saying that my graduation is coming soon, and\u2026\u00a0 I may be fit for their Software Development position. I go ahead and reply to the email and send my resume. I then get a phone interview in about 2 days.The phone interview was very relaxed. The interviewer was a Software Developer and asked me to talk about my projects and experience. He also described about the company and asked me why I chose to apply to Epic. Later on, he told me the opportunities available at Epic and how I would fit in good.The phone interview consisted of two technical question. One about linked lists and the other about some pointers. Although they were pretty easy, me being a EE major couldn't really answer them right away. But I showed them by thought process and the interviewer was quite impressed with that.Later on, the next day, I get an email to schedule an assessment test.The assessment test had four sections:1. 2 Minute Section2. Math3. New Programming language4. ProgrammingThe 2-Minute section had 10 SAT based questions to be solved in 2 minutes. I think this was basically to test out your speed and how quickly you respond to things.The Math section had 14 questions, and had pretty easy ones too. Not that bad for someone who's done Engineering. No probability or Statistics questions. Basic SAT based questions but a bit tricky.The New Language Section introduces a new programming language. It was easy. Just know the basics of programming and read the questions carefully and you'll get through them easily. Use common sense also, don't completely go by the questions. They are tricky too.Finally, the programming section had 4 questions. They were detail oriented. One had to carefully think it over. One of the questions was about seed product. Consider a number 123, the product of the number with its digits (123*1*2*3 = 738) is 738. Therefore, 123 is the seed product of 738. Write a program to accept a number and find all possible seed products. For example, If the user entered 4977 then the answer should be 79 and 711.Although, I couldn't do all of the questions and wrote one in pseudo code. I think the interview process is really amazing. But it also screens out a lot of people who can't program right away and need some syntax for help. I think Epic misses out on such people who might be extremely intelligent and might have a lot to offer from various fields of Engineering which Epic could really use.",

        "details": "I initially stumbled upon Epic booth at my university's career fair on my sophomore year's spring semester. By the way, Epic strongly believes in standardized tests, like SAT, and will definitely ask about the tests you took.I gave them my resume, completed their online application form, then got an email next day inviting for the on-site skills test. The test lasted for about 3 hours and had 3-4 programming problems\u2026\u00a0 where you can use any major programming language (you don't have to solve then if you are not applying for a technical problem), questions about a made-up programming language (aims to test your ability to learn new stuff and apply your knowledge), math questions, logic questions and a 1-minute math questions section. I might get some details wrong as it was a while ago, but there is enough information about Epic's skills test anyways. Then, I was told that there are no positions available at the moment and should apply during the Fall semester as they hire most interns then. During Fall semester Epic came to my university's career fair again and they actually contacted me through LInkedIn a couple of days before the fair. I applied through their website again and took the on-site skills test again. The test had the same structure but different questions. Then, a week later I got an email saying that the next step would be a phone interview with a software developer. The phone interview, however, did not contain any technical question, we talked more about my past projects and interests and I had a chance to ask questions about Epic. I asked about their immersion program (it is when Epic's software developers travel to hospitals to see how things really work there in general so that they can write a better soft) to kind of show that I am so interested in Epic that I did some research. I think she liked that. Another week later, I got an email inviting me to their headquarters in Madison, WI. I was also informed that one of two interviews would be with a software developer and I would briefly present a project I am most proud of or find most challenging. They also told that I must be ready to answer some questions about the project and that the whole interview would take about 30-45 minutes.Epic also asks you to bring your university transcripts and a list of three references to the interviews. In addition, I completed personality test online before coming to Madison.They payed for the flight, hotel and my experience in general was great as I was treated really well and the interviews were not stressful at all, I got a lot of information about what software developers do at Epic and had many chances to ask the developers anything I wanted during two group sessions with the actual developers, both completely informal and you are not evaluated or something. I had only two interviews and the first one was with a developer where I presented a project I worked in the past. You should really prepare for that as a developer would be asking all sorts of possible questions. My second interview was with HR. We started with questions about reference list I brought with me. She asked who of those three people knows me the best and why, what positive things he or she might say about you and what could be some negative things mentioned. Then there were a lot questions like why Epic, what do you like about our internship, what you don't like, what are your other options and how would you choose which offer to accept if you had several (like what factors are important to you). Then, a week later I had a phone call and was told that \"they decided to move forward with another candidates\".",

We scheduled an initial phone interview in which the interviewer simply went over my resume and confirmed whatever was written in it. It was a zero-stress thing.A week or so after that we scheduled an on-site interview. It honestly didn't feel like an interview. I basically talked to a bunch of Epic employees. They told\u2026\u00a0 me about Epic and Madison. I asked questions back. There was a brief campus tour and lunch at Epic's cafeteria with an employee as well. The official 'interview' was essentially a casual conversation with an Epic employee. They seem to be looking more at your aptitude and ability to learn new things than what you already know. Just be calm and be yourself.I had to take a programming test at the end of my interview as well as some very basic math/etc tests.",

        "details": "I heard about Epic through a friend who had already gone through the process and decided to apply. I was told they were still filling positions for software developers, and was directed to fill out the application online. I heard back a day or two later about setting up a phone screening. The phone screening was a software developer basically making sure I was a person. I was asked about\u2026\u00a0 my interests and some basic school background. There was one technical question about how I would implement something based on the interests I had expressed earlier.A few days later I received an email to set up an online testing session. The test was the basic math/speed/programming test you've probably read about online. I had prepared somewhat for this, but not much due to school work. I found the programming section to be fairly challenging.After a few more days, I received an email saying they were continuing with other candidates for software developer position (which I was expecting after taking the test), but they wanted to bring me up to interview for a Business Intelligence and Server Systems position. These were not really areas that I was interested in, but I didn't want to pass up the opportunity in case it turned out to be awesome. I took a personality test online and filled out the form for the interview and submitted it.For the interview, Epic puts you up in a very nice hotel in downtown Madison. The night before I opted to do the dinner tour. This was with three other candidates and our guide (Epic employee). The food was excellent and the walking tour was great.The next day I headed over to Epic for my interview day. Traffic was pretty bad on the way, but once arriving and checking in, I was given a folder with my plan for the day. Everyone starts with the Epic spiel, then a software demo. Next it was on to the Server Systems interview. This was in a small interview room - very laid back. I asked about the details of the position and was basically told it was server support, some Perl scripting, but mostly customer support since each client has a different back-end setup.Next I was off to a facility tour and then lunch. The tour was cool-the themedbuildings/areas are nice, but I didn't see any employees actually using these areas. Lunch was amazing! The food is heavily subsidized for employees (free for candidates on the interview day) \u2013 sandwich bar, salad bar, grilled fish, prime rib etc. The dining area is designed like a timber framed mountain lodge.After lunch I was off to the Business Intelligence interview. This actually started with an employee explaining the role and what they did. Extremely laid back. This lasted around ten minutes and then I was off to another room for the actual interview. I was interviewed by someone who looked to be barely out of high school and extremely uncomfortable. The interview was a case study (related to report writing/data presentation).I was then told to go and take a language test (like the SAT) and then head to my closing interview with HR. This was very laid back, just wanting to see how the day went, my thoughts on Epic and working there, and between the two positions I had interviewed for, which (if any) was leaning toward. Because I was really not interested in being a server support specialist, I said I was leaning more toward BI and was asked for percentages, to which I replied around 70/30.Almost two weeks later, I received a call stating that it was an extremely difficult decision but that they had decided to continue with other candidates. While it\u2019s always difficult to hear rejection, I feel it was the best decision for both parties. I had plenty of time to think about what I would do if I received an offer and came to the conclusion that I wanted to go into software development and it wasn't worth taking a position that I wasn't interested in simply because the pay was good (>70k) and the health benefits were great.Overall, the Epic hiring process is long. I think Epic would be a great place to work and I\u2019m sure a lot of it is what YOU make of your experience there. That being said, they do have an extremely high turnover (this is mostly related to the developers) and are pretty much always hiring. I was told by HR that they received something like 250K resumes/applications each year and interview hundreds of people each month. They are boosting their employee numbers by a couple of thousand I believe, so there are definitely jobs. If you make it to the interview process, it\u2019s a great experience and practice regardless of the outcome. I certainly do not regret my experience and everyone at Epic was more than friendly.Good luck!",

It was basically a report being created for a doctor and asked how it could be improved, how you would present it (what kind of graph) etc. Just look up BI case studies/examples and know some basics of SQL/Database queries/structure and you'll be fine. All other questions were typical interview questions. \u00a0"

Not extremely hard, but kind of tricky sometimes.A week later, they called me and flew me to Madison to the in-person interview. I had to give a 20-minute presentation about a project I had worked in to an engineer. Finally, a HR interview where they asked me how much would I like to earn.

They ended up being significantly late (about 45 min) calling me on the day we set up which made me a little worried at first, but this turned out to be more information gathering and not a true interview so I figured no big deal.Another couple of weeks and I got another email wanting to set up a technical interview which ended up being an internet proctored programming/logic/math test which I had up to 4 hours to complete (ended up only taking 2.5 so not all that bad). It involved some interesting problems that I had not seen before in lists of common interview questions.Then after about 6 weeks total of information gathering and assessment I finally got the email asking to fly me onsite for the interview. I got two nights in a nice hotel and dinner with a developer and 3 other recruits. The next morning I spent most of the day touring the campus and getting overviews of the software, job position, and general culture. My actual interview lasted about 25-30 minutes. Half was technical (a really simple set of questions involving developing and analyzing tic-tac-toe win state algorithms) and the other half behavioral (talk about a past project, what you did, and what you got out of it basically).

After initiating the process there were a couple of phone interviews, but one was just an HR person needing clarification about some things on my Resume. About a week after that, I got an email saying they wanted me to schedule a proctored test at\u2026\u00a0 a nearby career testing center. The test had some programming problems, some questions about a made up language, and some basic math and logic questions. Some of the questions are tricky, but the programming problems are a little on the hard side.About a week after the proctored test, I was offered the on-site interview. At the same time, they asked me to complete a quick personality and logic test. They are very friendly to married people/couples. They offered for me to bring a guest to Madison (they paid for the plane fare, hotel cost, meals, and even cab fare for her to explore Madison while I was in the interview). They also paid for an extra night of hotel costs for us to stay an extra day and explore Madison more. They arranged for us to have dinner with an Epic employee and other candidates the days before and after the interview. They took us to nice restaurants and paid for everything (no alcohol -- the company policy is pretty strict about alcohol).The interview itself was more like an introduction to Epic than an actual interview. It lasted all day. There was an introduction to Epic, a software demonstration, a conversation with someone from your role, you have to give a presentation on a project that you worked on in the past, there is a quick math/logic test, and a bigger math/logic test. Unfortunately I can't go into any more depth than that. The on-site interview was the easiest part of the process, though.The people here seem very driven. The typical work week for SDs seems to be 45-50 hours per week, but sometimes work far more than that. Deadlines are never changed, so if you're approaching a deadline, you stay at work until everything is finished. I wouldn't even bother applying if all you want is a 9-to-5 job. Even if you get hired, you will probably be miserable and want to quit. Don't be discouraged by all the negative posts in the Epic reviews section -- I'm fairly certain that those are just people that didn't really mesh with the Epic way of doing things. For people with the right personality type, Epic is a joy to work at.There is free Milk/Juice/Coffee/Tea in the break rooms. No soda, though. Being a healthcare company, company policy is very strongly worded against soda, alcohol, and tobacco use. The dress code is pretty relaxed.

I had a dinner with an employee from Epic when I arrived in Madison, it was a good experience because he was friendly and willing to answer any questions. Then on the second day I went to Epic to do the interview. The interview process is not very complex, including a tour in their campus, talking with an employee about the position you applied, making a informal presentation about one project you have done, answering some behavior questions from the HR and solving 10 math questions in 2 minutes (I think it is really difficult to solve all questions in 2 minutes, so just try to solve as many as you can).After the on-site interview, I received a phone call and was asked to go to the test center again. The reason is that because of a system bug I didn't receive the math test there at the first time. So I went there again to finish the last part of my interview. The math questions are harder than I thought, there are some tricks in it so I think all the candidates should be careful with them.I finished the last part on Friday, and got the offer on Wednesday in next week.",

I, along with several other interviewees, were split into groups led by a current employee who showed us around Madison, and we had an opportunity\u2026\u00a0 to ask questions in an informal setting.The next day, we went to Epic's campus. There, we were split into groups based on which position we were interviewing for and given a tour of the campus, as well as a few demos of some of the projects they were working on. Later, in our groups, we met with a current developer who described the experience working at Epic as a software developer as well as information about the work (e.g. language, libraries, tools, types of projects, organization of teams, etc). We later each met one-on-one another developer for a technical interview covering our past work, problem solving approach.After that, we sent to a testing room for 3 different tests which were administered in an environment familiar to anyone that's taken standardized tests. One test covered basic skills (e.g. basic math, communication and writing skills). Another covered general technical questions about software development. The last test introduced, piecemeal, a hypothetical programming language (though seemingly similar to the Cach\u00e9 language they use for many of their projects) and asked questions about expressions/statements written in that language.Finally after our tests, we wrapped up with a one-on-one meeting with an HR person to discuss our career goals, anticipated salary, feedback about the company, feedback about the interview process, and similar matters.",

There was a stereotypical interview by an HR person (where do you want to be in five years, etc.).Insight into my technical abilities was mostly via written tests. There were three (math, programming logic, programming). I signed that I wouldn't describe the question. While not trivial, they weren't too hard for anyone with a decent background. It felt like they were attempting to judge my quality without respect to specific technologies. While it wasn't obvious how good the process is, I appreciated the fact that it wasn't focused on small technical details that can be looked up in a manual.I got a nice tour of Epic (it's a very nice campus, if a bit isolated) and a brief demo of the software.I'll need to wait a couple of weeks to learn the results of the interview process.",

        "details": "The hiring process was very slow. I attended my interviews in May and got the final result only in July. For getting the final result, I had to email them multiple times regularly. After much assurances and delay i got the result in July and the email said they are moving ahead with other candidates.One thing that i found weird was evaluating freshers and people having 4+ years of experience\u2026\u00a0 at the same level. The technical interview panel did not ask any questions related to my work, and was more inclined towards asking puzzles. I found this as highly unprofessional. Here the college students held an edge because they are more inclined towards preparing for these.First i had to take an online test -Rembrandt Profile.Then i had a phone interview - which was more about discussing my profile, and creating a rosy picture of work culture at Epic. I did a lot of research about Epic after this interview, and saw a huge difference between what the general opinion was and what the guy on the interview was saying. I deemed it as an eye wash.Third round was a written technical and aptitude assessment. I was clubbed with around 45 odd college students and had to take this up at their college.I got a call next day from a technical panel for a personal interview. The interview was odd, as the person was more inclined towards asking their set of questions. He had very slight idea of what i was doing and what tech i knew. In the end he asked me a puzzle related to finding the best match/ binary sort. I was confused after this round.After technical review (which was hardly technical), i met the HR person. He was polite and asked me about the details which i had filled on their application form. I had quoted 85k to 90k annual salary, on which the HR did raise some eyebrows. But later he said EPIC pays handsome salaries.I was in two minds after this process and dint give it too much of a thought. After 2 long months and sending atleast 10 follow up mails, i got a mail that \"it was a difficult decision for us but we have decided to proceed with other candidates\".The whole process is weird. I would not recommend anyone having some experience to consider EPIC. The job that they would be offering would not be worth it. It might be a good firm for freshers though. Because it came out clearly from the interview process, that they wanted to hire cheap labour in the form of freshers and the technical panel itself wasnt technical enough to interview experienced candidates.",

There also were word analogy questions in there too: \"Sun : Basketball :: Moon : Golf-ball/ping-pong ball/football/soccer ball\". Finally, there were some pure math questions, which didn't seem to have anything to do with psychology profiling.The phone interview occurred soon after that. I expected a technical interview, but it was mostly HR, with questions about my recent projects and such.I was then told that I'd need to take a skills assessment test. This one is not online but needs to be proctored by some sort of 3rd party professional proctor. I took mine at the local library. There were 5 questions, each requiring some code in any popular language (or even psuedo-code). You are supposed to write down your start and end times for each question, because apparently the time you take for each question is factored into the grading. This means you really aren't supposed to go back and fix an answer to a previous question. The first 4 questions were easy, CS1 questions. The last one was trickier: \"Write a function which, given n, prints all well-ordered integers of n digits. A well ordered number is one where the value of the i-th digit is less than the value of the i+1 digit.\"I got rejected after the seemingly simple skills test.

        "details": "Submitting an application required a lot of educational stats: GPA, SAT/ACT scores, and the like. It's definitely a process geared toward entry-level candidates (though there is still room for experienced hires, and the offer took my experience into account when it came). The phone screening was quick, easy, and straightforward -- seemed to be mostly just a surface check to screen for obvious unsuitability.On-site interviews: I was expected to drive\u2026\u00a0 myself, which took about five hours. Some people get flown in, I'm sure, but I guess I was within the get-here-on-your-own radius. They put me up in a hotel in downtown Madison, very near State Street -- surely aimed at showing off the city in its liveliest and most metropolitan light. It felt like a hefty drive the next morning to get from there to the campus. I had to give myself plenty of time to make sure I got through the city's morning traffic and a bunch of miles.The day featured a lot of variety. The recruiters spent as much time selling me on Epic as they did evaluating me. We got some all-around pleasant propaganda for the company and the city, plus a quick tour of part of the campus.But I certainly had work to do. The lengthiest and most challenging element was the battery of written exams, which included a pair of programming skills tests. I was told they'd be graded on accuracy and speed of completion. (The sort of person who enjoys pencil-and-paper puzzles will do very well in this process.)I found myself in several small-group settings as well, given opportunities to learn about the software, to talk to a developer and ask questions about the job, and to eat lunch with an Epic employee in more of a casual social setting. I later learned that even my small-group lunch was evaluated -- our host was expected to send written comments on each of us back to HR. I suppose it was meant to screen friendliness or personality; I can't imagine what else you could judge from lunch.I also spent an hour in a 1-on-1 setting with another developer. Probably the most stressful setting of the day, but it wasn't so bad. My interviewer led by lobbing programming problems at me to see how I'd do, and from there we shifted into discussion of specific technical project experience. I'd been told beforehand to come prepared to discuss a development project of interest from my past. The instructions mentioned preparing a visual aid ahead of time, but I'm sure I could have done without it. It was a typical interview; candidates will do well by staying relaxed, demonstrating knowledge and passion, and developing a comfortable rapport with the interviewer.I'm proud to say I did not not seek the test questions online beforehand, which is of course cheating. But I did study before the on-site day, brushing up on core CS concepts like sorting, recursion, algorithms, vocabulary. I'm sure it helped on the tests and in the 1-on-1 interview. But even if all it does is help to maintain confidence, it's worth the time.After all that, it's a waiting game. They've just collected a ton of information on a ton of people, and it takes time to process it all. I finally got a call about two weeks after my on-site visit -- it feels interminable while you're waiting, but there's nothing you can do. Once Epic's run all its results through whatever formula they've got, if they like what they see, they'll start contacting references, and then it's not long before Epic calls with their decision. In my case, they called as soon as they got off the phone with my reference.To anyone about to submit themselves to this process, it's a great place to work. Good luck!",

I send my resume, a month later the phone screen happens. Then I am invited to a 3 hour appointment for a series of skill examination, about 3 weeks after the phone screen. The tests were completed in less than 2 hours,\u2026\u00a0 and many questions were funny in a geeky way.They stress on your ability to learn new stuff rather than what you already know, which is very good especially for the inexperienced, but prevents some of the experienced from shining. The test questions also revealed the informal, laid-back culture. For example, some questions had no real answer, and the answers were like \"a) All of the below b) All of the above c) None of the below d) None of the above e) A combination of the above\".A couple months later, the on-site interview. At that point you get introduced to the area and are treated to a nice hotel and food. A technical interview, followed by a personality test and language/math tests. The technical interviewer asks you a few questions about what you worked on, but spends the majority of his time speaking about the company, technologies and work projects that you can expect.There is also a demo of the software, brief but gives you an idea of how the end-product/system looks like.You also have lunch with a member of the staff. That person was a little negative, kept telling me about the long hours he was to work. Kind of a gloomy picture for someone on their interview.Finally, you have a chat with the HR person that asks you traditional interview questions (describe a time you did something silly at work, or describe a time you had to work under pressure). Questions intentionally easy and designed to get you feel comfortable about the opportunity.Then 3-4 weeks later, you get a job offer with about 3-4 weeks to respond (starts with a week or 2, but can usually be extended).",

The MC was pretty easy learn a new language from scratch.

They like to make themselves look unique.There are two onsite interviews. I had to present a project of mine in one and go over a case study in the other.

The questions weren't difficult, but your result is assessed based both on accuracy and speed, so even thought they say you don't need to prepare and it isn't timed, I suggest you do yourself a mock test and see how long it takes you.

It doesn't matter what you tell them, they need ppl for a certain\u2026\u00a0 role and that's what you are going to get, hence the emphasis on college grads.I have 15 yrs of experience in software development and the last 5 being in management. Even during the initial phone screen, I made it absolutely clear that I was looking for a technical + management position and not a pure coding one. After a 2 hr coding test, I was finally called on site. to my surprise it was still for a s/w developer and \"Implementer\" role.I figured they met lead or something so I went ahead. The interview was absolutely disappointing. I met about 4-5 ppl, varying in experience from 1 yr to 3 yrs. Each telling me what a day in a s/w developer life is. For god sake I've been in this industry to 15 yrs, I know what a day is going to be like. They were resonably smart but terribly immature and in experienced. They have no clue on how to interview any one with experience. One of them ever told me that he normally interviews only fresh college grads so he's not quite sure how to proceed.What a total waste of time. anyone who would have taken even a slightest look at my resume would have known that they do not have any position for me. They have it all geared towards fresh grads, including the silly SAT/GRE type tests and language and math skills, extremely lame in my view.This is no company for experience, great if you need somewhere to start, but honestly if you are looking for a career (after having one) don't waste your time.At the end the recruiter is asking me if I am interested in an \"Implementer role\" heck no... what part of s/w leadership don't you understand... anyway waste of time...Only positive is their hospitality.
