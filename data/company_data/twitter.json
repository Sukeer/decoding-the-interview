Contacted by recruiter to complete two coding challenges on HackerRank. Completed these and was scheduled for a phone interview the next week.The phone discussion was comfortable and enjoyable. The interview moved very fast, which was ok for me because I typically speak fast, but if you like\u2026\u00a0 to take a moment or two to think that was not allotted for. There was a brief discussion of some larger networking/sys admin concept and systems. The coding portion was quite brief. The only question I did not answer as desired was the last in regards to a specific rate limiting algorithm I simply was not familiar with. I proposed a structure that would solve the problem, but perhaps not as efficiently, and I am not sure if the Interviewer understood what I meant by my answer. With the pace that was kept during the interview, it was not possible for me to clarify. However, considering we were coding and working in high level languages and concepts, I would not have thought to drop to a much lower level algorithm quickly, even if I had been familiar with it.Clearly there are some buzz words or \"gotchas\" that were being screened for. I've had phone screens were I have been less fluid and immediately correct in my answers that I have passed. The auto-deny on my resume but consideration by a recruiter would indicate this as well. In addition, my phone interview was scheduled as a \"SW Eng, Entry Level\" when it was very clearly for Site Reliability Engineer. Prepare and be comfortable in the phone screen and understand that whatever system they use to find talent may still be maturing.Twitter still holds to the old-school notion that they will not share feedback from your application and they make a point of stating this in the denial email. This practice simply continues the adversarial relationship many employees and job seekers feel in regard to corporations. It is strange that modern technology companies plucking from a high demand applicant pool would continue this practice, as providing feedback to applicants would only help them grow professionally (and not on the company's dollar) and make them more likely to reapply successfully in the future.",

The followup to that question involved the scenario where the number<->letter mapping involved numbers with more than one digit, e.g. 1 = [A|B|C], 2 = [D|E|F], 12=[X|Y|Z].After that It was an onsite interview with ~6 people (2 hiring managers) with one team. I was asked to implement isHappy() where you return false if a number whose digits squared don't add up to 1, true otherwise. I was asked to write the merge() portion of a mergesort. I was asked JS-specific questions, specifically the context of \"this\", closures, implementing bind(). I was asked to implement the DOM selector portion of jQuery. Debugging an issue with some JS code (knowledge about JS and using the browser's debugger).I was asked to come on site a second time to talk to another team with just 2-3 people. I was asked to listi all RHN numbers (defined as a scenario where there's a pair of unique numbers whose cube add up to the same number). Finding the longest palindrom of a string. Returning the k most frequent words in a string delimited by space.I did well on the technical aspects of the interview, but apparently didn't express enough interest in joining the company: recruiters will ask you to verbally accept an offer if your interview goes well -- it would be wise to do so.

There was no real pattern to the questions except for the fact that they covered your typical Computer Science fundamentals.Actually, I expected more questions about scale and design. The only person who touched on that sort of thing was a Senior Software Engineer but it was really round about how he got to it.Overall, not a really bad experience, but based on the feedback, I have to believe they could have made up their mind more quickly.",

This in itself wasn't unexpected but his aggressive attitude was. A very short time into my explanation he got kind of aggressive and started bashing the\u2026\u00a0 project for its perceived faults, despite the fact that he hadn't touched on the actual requirements.To my personal discredit, rather than point out that fact, and lay out the requirements and the techincal merits of what I did, I got defensive and it all went down hill. Note to other interviewees... don't do that :). Just stand your ground and seek clarification or state clearly why you think their viewpoint isn't valid.

        "details": "Short version:The most disorganized, disrespectful, and unprofessional hiring process I've ever experienced. Avoid.LONG version:I applied online, and was contacted by someone from HR to solve a simple coding question and send my solution by email.After that, had a phone interview, had to code some algorithms on a shared document. Nothing complex, but it didn't go well because I went in completely unprepared, and realized my CS basics had got quite\u2026\u00a0 rusty over the years.Nevertheless, to my surprise, had a second phone interview, same type of questions, and this time things went much better, as I had been refreshing the typical algorithms and data structures material.I was called onsite, and had a full day of interviews with several members of the engineering team. Again, same type of problems, related to algorithms, data structures, complexity analysis, the usual things.Before this, I had been preparing even more, and I think my performance was pretty good.Up to this point everything went super well, the people were nice, great atmosphere at the office, a very good experience.Now HR takes over, and the chaos starts.So after some time someone from HR contacts me, and says they're working on an offer for me. Great news!A few emails and phone calls were exchanged, discussing possible offer numbers, locations, etc.I'm told all is set, I'd be getting an offer very very soon. Still great news.The \"getting an offer very soon\" is repeated week after week, but there's always something that's delaying the process, or someone that we're waiting for.So, I wait, and wait some more.More than 2 months pass, always with regular contact with HR people, and still I'm told everything is being taken care of.A different HR person takes over, and apparently he is clueless about who I am, how I got there, and basically doesn't know anything about what happened so far.But after some weird phone conversations, the status is the same: \"yeah, you'll have an offer in hand this week\".Then he calls me and says that the previous recruiter made some errors with my process, and they are rechecking everything.Needless to say that I'm shocked by this, but what can I do... Apparently we're back on ground zero or something.The recruiter didn't remember what we had discussed on the phone a week before, and asks me ridiculous questions like:\"Are you a new grad?\" (I've graduated more than 12 years ago, as is obvious if he just had glanced over my CV);\"Did you interview at our office?\" (excuse me?!)This made me wonder, have they lost my file? Have they lost my interview scores? Do they know who I am? What happened?I was almost in a panic, but still, we keep contact and I wait for some progress.Again, the same old, \"we're waiting for person X to do Y\", and later \"if you don't hear from me by day X contact me\".Day X comes. No feedback. I email the recruiter. No answer.Two weeks pass. More emails. Still no answer.Recruiter contacts me, and says they are still \"trying to work on this\".Finally, after FIVE months of this, recruiter contacts me and says that they are NOT going forward with an offer.This whole process was just a huge waste of time, made me lose other opportunities, and caused immense stress on me and my family (we would be moving to San Francisco from Europe, then suddenly we were left hanging on uncertainty for months).Very very negative experience.",

We agreed on dates for the 2 remaining phone screens which again went pretty well.He then asks me if I can fly down to San Francisco (I am based out of Bangalore) which I said I would be glad to but ask if I can take a few rounds over skype to speed up the process. He ended up scheduling 4 rounds over skype. After the interviews, he informs me that the feedback was positive and he would set up another round with an Engineering manager. My internet connection had some issues during the call with the Manager but I am confident I was able to answer the single design question he ask me. After the interview, I had a couple of questions to ask but he complained that my voice was breaking up and he thanked me for my time and ended the interview.I was really shocked when the recruiter calls me up the next day and informs me that the Manager \"did not find me a good fit\".

I have just one problem, whenever I get interviews with companies like Google, Facebook, only thing that comes in my mind is problem solving and algorithms/data structures questions. Didn't expect a design question to show up during the interview , and because of this what\u2026\u00a0 happens is, the interview process becomes very unstable, in case of Google/Facebook or any other top notch companies, I believe the questions are always around problem solving rather than language focused or even design problems are bit unexpected, which definitely isn't an invalid question to get asked but I feel, Twitter needs to create a standardized process in terms of it's questions. I feel that the reason for such scenario is, Twitter Bangalore doesn't have engineers from Google or Facebook background, perhaps that's why the engineers that they hired were asking mostly random design questions. I hope , if somebody from Twitter US recruitment team is reading this, they can understand the whole thing about the interview process, try to make it same everywhere rather than confusing candidates . Look, anyone can ask tough questions in interviews, no big deal, but if questions are really very random , especially Twitter being one of top notch companies, I'm not sure if Twitter US and Twitter Bangalore are really on the same page in terms of technical interview process, at least the nature of the questions.",

I got attracted by the company so I decided to go for it and I started the hiring process. Passed.2/ I jumped into a first phone screen with a tech guy, probably a hiring manager he seems to have a few years of experience. Smart\u2026\u00a0 guy asking relevant questions related to the role I was applying to. It might sound obvious but normally interviewers/developers don't really know how to interview people. inexperienced. They end up grabbing a random algorithm question from the Web and they ask the candidate to play with it. I'm talking about stuff you deal with at school when you have to be a guru in algorithm in order to get your degrees. I think I was since I have a Master's degree in CS. Why would you even ask this kind of question today now that I have 5-6 years of exp? Anyway, so this one was great and smart so we went from Web site optimization, caching, scalability, design to JavaScript good practices in general. The interview went pretty well. Oops.. I almost forgot the algorithm question at the end. About 5-10 minutes maximum going through a tree structure (DOM), making sure my degrees aren't fake. Passed.3/ Second phone interview. what I call a big mistake... letting a young developer who probably never worked outside of Twitter judging a potential candidate. He wasn't experienced clearly, overconfident, almost annoying, especially when he introduced himself at the beginning: \"I work at Twitter you don't, I'm better than you since you're trying to get in\". That's the message I got from him. Anyway, result of his lack of experience he jumped straight into a blank document where I had to write a tricky and boring algorithm for the rest of the interview... about 40 minutes. It consists on picking up the trickiest question on the Web, asking the candidate to come up with the solution and watching him fail. I know what it is since I interviewed a lot of candidates myself. I talked to colleagues too and they do this kind of stuff (I don't). The sad part is that the problem can be resolved in less than 5 seconds, just google it, copy/past end of the story. Which means the question is not relevant at all. I wasn't mad about that since I had a rough solution in mind. I just had to code it since he would use it as a reference for the final decision. It was a bit tricky in a blank file with no syntax highlighter. But the main problem was his attitude as he was walking around in a very loud place (cafeteria?) while I was trying to resolve the problem. He didn't cut his mic. When he realized his mic was on he finally cut it. So I lost him for about 15 minutes. I was on my own talking to my self he wasn't listening/answering. I wanted to end the interview after 30 minutes I was annoyed. I tried to come up with a partial solution. He finally turned on his mic and sounded like he was doing something else \"so... where are we?\". He stopped me and asked for questions about Twitter, etc.. He told me that the next step would be to come onsite for a face to face interview with 3-4 developers. He said that I'll have to figure that out with the recruiter. Passed?4/ Nop... email from the recruiter a day after: \"you're not a right fit\".Conclusion: I still like there product, simple and powerful with a lot of potential. But it is such a huge mistake to let inexperienced developers judging a potential future employee. Hiring someone is a big deal. It's about hiring the next talents who will bring new ideas and will impact the vision of the product. If you let a young dude like him rejecting people for no reason they you put yourself in a weird spot.",
