        "details": "First off, the start to the interview felt very cold. The interviewer did not introduce himself. He seemed uninterested and un prepared for the interview which is evident from the fact that, I was asked what my name was and whether I was interviewing for a full time position or an internship. It felt like he just wanted to get it over with.With in the first 5 minutes, I was\u2026\u00a0 asked why I had applied for CISCO despite not having any network experience. While it is a legitimate question, it just gave a very negative vibe. I was taken aback but I tried to gather myself and pointed to my 2 years of work experience with Ericson and we had a conversation about that.At this point, I figured I wasn\u2019t doing so well and as I was trying hard to collect my thoughts. The interviewer seemed to show signs of impatience and borderline annoyance; which made it all the more difficult to think straight. I was asked another question about centralized and distributed systems which I could not answer well mostly due to my own fault.Next we moved on to my knowledge about languages and I was asked vague questions such as \u201cHow much do you know about python?\u201d \u201cHow much do you know about C++?\u201d and \u201cHow much do you know about UNIX\u201d? I tried to answer the questions by stating how I had used these languages in my projects in grad school and my professional career.Towards the end, I felt like the interviewer hadn\u2019t looked in detail over my resume and we did not talk about the most interesting and innovative projects that I worked on in grad school. I broached this topic and gave a brief overview of the kind of projects I worked on. That brought us towards the end of the interview.Overall, the interviewer seemed unprofessional, interested and seemed noticeably annoyed when my answers were not what he was looking for. This made it all the more hard for me to recover from a bad start. While I most definitely would not blame the interviewer for my poor performance, I wish he was more professional and less annoyed so that the entire experience would have been a positive one despite my bad performance.I had done badly in interviews before with companies like Facebook and Amazon, but I was made to feel welcome and I was intellectually challenged in the interviews. In the end I always came out of the interviews thoroughly enjoying them even though I knew I may not have done well. Unfortunately CISCO has been a polar opposite experience where I was and made to feel unwelcome and my intellectual capabilities were not tested.",

The interview consisted of talking about my resume and some coding questions. My interviewer asked about all of the technical skills listed on my resume, and since I know Java, he asked me some Java language-specific questions (describe polymorphism in Java...). He also asked a brain teaser at the end.During the\u2026\u00a0 interview he told me I should expect to move on in the process because my GPA was high enough. About a week to 2 weeks after the interview, I received a letter of intent to hire from Cisco. I was asked to pick between San Jose, Atlanta, or Research Triangle Park. Also, I was asked to rank my preference for the following positions: Application Development, Embedded Systems, and Test Engineer. I sent in my preferences (I asked for Application Development, Research Triangle Park) but I was told that there were no positions other than Test Engineer available at RTP, so I was placed on a waitlist, with no guarantee of getting an offer unless something opened up.However, I heard back again with an actual offer within another 2 weeks. This was for Embedded Systems in RTP. The salary was not competitive with my other offers, so I declined. Also, there was no human contact throughout the entire process, other than the on-campus interview, and they didn't offer to even bring me in for an on-site visit, so I would not have felt comfortable accepting the position even with a competitive salary.",

Unfortunately, I was travelling, and asked him whether we\u2026\u00a0 could prearrange a time, so that I could make myself available. He was willing to do that, but, he wanted to have the interview within the next couple of days. So, we scheduled it for the next day.During the interview he first asked me about my PhD research work. That went on for about 15min. He seemed mildly impressed (I think). Then he moved on to few behavioral, and technical questions. The technical questions were from Algorithms and DS, C/C++, OOP and Networking. Apart from couple of questions, I did well in the rest. The most difficulty I had was understanding the thick accent (South East asian, I think) my interviewer had. But, he was really friendly.Finally he went through my resume and asked me several questions about my experience and background. I thought he got more interested in my after that round, since according to him \"I have an impressive resume\".The whole interview went on for about 1hr, and he concluded by asking to contact him in about couple of weeks, if I didn't hear from him or Cisco. I followed up the interview by sending a thank you email to my interviewer; he once again asked me to contact him if I didn't hear from him soon.But, even after repeated emails (after waiting for 3 weeks), I am yet to hear back from him or Cisco. Overall, I had a positive impression about the interview (even though they called out of the blue, and asked me to interview in a hurry ~ I haven't had that experience with any other company). However, not getting back to me with their decision (don't care what it is), is really unprofessional for a company like Cisco. I don't think I would consider Cisco in the future, even though I am in the Networking field.",

It doesn't seem that Cisco needs brilliant people. People with good programming skills who know simple things like code optimization,data structures, few relevant projects go thru to the final stage. But,what I learned was that one position has about 10 people contesting and say 5 are upto the mark. After this I think the hiring decision becomes a subjective one .

Around 250-300 people\u2026\u00a0 wrote the first test and 60 of us got selected for the next round. The second round was panel interview which the recruiters started immediately after declaring the results of the first round. My interview was conducted by a 2 member panel. My first round score was good as were my academics scores which aided gain some comfort in the interview. We had to submit the resumes before the interview started. My main subject of interest is networks, so they routed me to a panel which had an interviewer well versed in networks. I told my subjects of interests as networks and OS( operating systems). The panel members grilled me tested my technical knowledge relating to these fields. They asked me some questions on the projects that I had mentioned in my resume.The technical questions ranged from basics to specifics. The interview went on for around 30-35 minutes. I answered most of the questions (about 80-85%) with detailed explanation wherever needed but could not answer some of the questions for which my answer was a plain \"I don't know, Sir\". After the first round of interviews , they called me again and asked about my final year project and my plans on future studies and career. This lasted for 10-15 minutes after which all of us had to wait for around 3-4 hours meanwhile they completed the interview rounds for all the first round selects. Then there was a casual HR interview. The questions were also casual testing my soft skills.All these interview processes were carried out on a single day. After all processes and procedures they declared the names of the final selects at 12 in the mid night! They selected 13 people from our college out of them 8 were recruited for software engineering profile ( I was one of them :) ) and others for IT profiles.",

First one was hiring manager himnself. Gave a C test. Simple sorted array merging. I had rusty\u2026\u00a0 hands. Followed by another enginner who grilled me on OS concepts. How is executable format stored and loaded. Where are variables stored. How are interrupts handled etc. Majorly OS related stuff. Also recursion C questions. This was followed by another round of hard core questions on OS, threads and non amskable interrupts followed by a simple question on linked list. Need to know basics about datas tructures and algorithms. Which one is more efficient etc. After this a member from different team came by, asked some questions on my earlier work and another tree recursion program. This followed by the hiring manager of another team, asked basic question on my previous work and other problem solving scenarios when two processes are communicating with each other(IPCs). I was asked to come by for a second round after a week. The first 1:1 was difficult for me. Some questions on semaphores, mutexes. C programming question specifically targeting your knowledge of bitwise operators and memory management. Did not do so well. This followed by simple rounds by 2 other persons. Previous work. Multiple processor programming etc.. Overall, I probably needed more experience in the area that they wanted. Did not get the offer.",
