        "details": "My on-site technical interview sessions are about 45 minutes each but the engineers\u2019 attention span on coding sessions last about 35 minutes. So after eliminating the introduction, the explanation of the question, you should time yourself to have a complete code with correct results within 25-30 minutes. The thinking process does not count. Only code with correct output counts. They said very clear the code need to be correct.My second\u2026\u00a0 coding question is on a system integration coding problem. After googling the needed system calls for Ruby, I start coding with the top search result. On the first run, the system is blocked. Good practice told me to verify the connectivity and I spend 8 minutes to eliminate some important possibilities. I realize time is running fast. So I ask whether I can have more help. He said \u201cI told you already but you are not listening\u201d. When you put high pressure on the candidate, some subtle suggestion is not obvious and there are many other un-related messages. There are a few more remarks that I consider not professional or fair. At the end, he suggested me for a particular system call. Then the integration code works. Unfortunately, he also end the interview even though it was started 5 minutes late. After he left, I managed to finish the business code in 5 minutes and I emailed the code to the recruiter. But I knew it would not count.At first, I blame bad luck of finding the wrong Ruby API on the google search. But on the way home, I realized I should have more faith in google search than their home grown system component used for interviews. I replicate the reason why the API call is blocked in 5 minutes and duplicate their component. The first Ruby code does work with most common systems but not theirs because the way of how they want it to work. Their approach is not common for distributed and scalable system and therefore only popup later in my head.Their interview standard has reached a very un-healthy level. The second coding question have too many variables of going wrong in real life. With the time constraints, luck becomes a more dominate factor rather than a real life approach. There is a chance that the bar has raised too high that more top candidates are failing while more cheaters pass. The technical community is small. Sharing interview questions are far more common.I will not be a good candidate for them. Only the first interview contains real life industrial strength issues. For the rest of technical interviews, you should check out all those online site posting brain teasing programming question. I start wonder why we need to spend 4 years college. Experience will not pull you ahead of others. To hack those interviews, it will be easier of spending a few months intensively on those site instead.",

He\u2026\u00a0 talked about himself A LOT and not really about the company and went straight to the problem without even asking me any relevant questions. It was not an interview to be honest because I had NO chance to prove what I am capable of as a SWE. When I was coding and making a mistake (due to rush and that I would have corrected few seconds later) he was literally LAUGHING at me which was distracting so when I have had enough I asked him if there is any inputs he wanted to add because he kept interrupting me in my thoughts' flow? he said \"no go ahead I am sorry to interrupt you\". He was quite disrespectful. I did solve the problem and it was working but he seemed like he was in a rush. So I had 2 questions asked quite simple. I was really disappointed in the process and I think I could have solved that problem in less than 20min if he was not interrupting me everytime.I am not sure what really went wrong to be honest. I spent 1 week preparing for this so I was extremely disappointed by that \"technical interview\".As stated in many other posts, it seems like they do not really care unless you have been referred, known by someone in the company or comes from big enterprises or schools.My first recruiter was very professional lady. I wish the same professionalism could be applied in every other steps with the other technical recruiters.",

So I extended my stay (my own expenses as I am not a local candidate) and got ready for onsite interviews. When I went there, and asked for the agenda - the HR tells me - that its going to be just 1 interview - similar to a phone interview except that its going to be in person. I was shocked. I showed them the email where they confirmed me for onsite and they simply stated it was a communication mishap. This costed me heavily in terms of time and money. The HR seemed very careless and inefficient.As for the interview, the interviewer asked me a Dynamic Programming question (hard one) and said - he didn't care how I implemented it but just wanted a working code in 30 mins. I tried and was very close to the solution. I had a minor bug in the base case of my recursion. The interviewer just stood up at the 30 min mark and left abruptly. I came out and quickly tried the solution in my laptop. I was able to complete it and get it working in another 5 mins. But from the looks of it, there is no credit for implementation idea, thought process or any such thing.Overall, very negative experience.",
