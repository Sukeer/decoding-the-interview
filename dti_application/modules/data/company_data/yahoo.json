I was invited for an onsite, after clearing the initial phone screen\u2026\u00a0 which was fairly a simpler algorithmic challenge. Just revisit your algorithms and data structures especially search, sort, list, trees, graphs, string manipulations etc. An advice to candidates is to not to over do the preparation as they come with a mind set expecting 'the' answer they were looking for and even if you out smart them with an efficient solution it's still frowned upon (which is rather untrue for most companies in the silicon valley).The onsite interviews were pathetic, with some interviewers jumping straight onto white-board coding without even a formal introduction. The questions ranged from generating random numbers between 1 and N given a function which returns 0 or 1 with equal probability (binary to decimal!), ways to provide contradicting assignment statements from a list of string assignments of the form ['a=b', 'c=d', 'd=b'] ['a!=d'] etc, string anagram matching, binary search trees. The engineers seemed technically sound/professional and will indeed provide you enough hints in case you run into troubled waters.",

            "The most difficult question asked was to prove the upper bound on the number of nodes in a balanced binary tree. In order to prove it, the interviewer was looking for me to provide an inductive proof (this question caught me extremely off guard, have not done proofs in like three years). Definitely one of the more difficult interviews I have had, but I was very unprepared. My phone interviewer\u2026\u00a0 told me to expect an intense onsite coding interview where I was going to be expected to write an iOS application (experience is in mobile applications and I was interviewing for Yahoo Sports mobile). As a result, I spent a lot of time studying/practicing OOP and writing objective-c code. Much to my surprise when I was invited onsite, my interview was simply whiteboard coding questions. Most of the questions were binary tree and graph algorithm questions. In retrospect, I could have done much better on this interview if I were not misled by the previous engineer. Deep copy of a graph, dijkstras, order level tree traversal, big integer addition (just some of the questions). In short do not rely on engineers or HR to help you, study on your own and focus on graphs and trees.HR made it a terrible experience. Engineers were also very anti-social and seemed to only care if you get the question right without regard for your approach. I also kept getting interrupted rudely while trying to write down code which confused me a lot and made me perform even worse. No point in working for or with people like that, imagine the frustration! \u00a0"

The first part was on algorithms and data structures and the second part was on general C/C++. We spent about 5 minutes talking about a recent project that I have done, and\u2026\u00a0 at the end of the interview he asked me if I had any questions.My second interview was a couple of weeks later, it was very similar to the first, except that we spent the entire time on data structures / algorithms.Three weeks later I got a call for another phone interview. This one was very similar to the second interview.At the end of the interview, the interviewer told me that I would be contacted to come to Yahoo for 1:1 interviews.I didn't get any reply from them for almost a month, and then they wrote to me saying, sorry we ran out of backend positions!They asked if I would I like to interview for other positions. I decided to do so, and in the fourth interview, the interviewer asked me what position I was most interested in. I said, back end engineer. He said that in that case, he would arrange a back end position interview for me, and he would get back to me soon.Next week I got a rejection email from Yahoo.",
