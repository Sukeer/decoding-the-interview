        "details": "The TripAdvisor interview process took a long time. I first interviewed in September 2014 and received my offer in December 2014. I really wanted to work for them so I stuck it through even tho the process was long.I handed in my resume at my university career in September. I was invited to interview the next day on-campus. I interviewed with a senior technical manager and he was friendly and\u2026\u00a0 asked me two coding questions to do with trees (the first one was pretty easy and the second was more involved). We talked about what I was looking for (in terms of what I wanted to work on) and the different office locations for engineers at TripAdvisor.Since my campus interview went well and I said I want to do mobile engineering, TripAdvisor set-up a Skype interview with one of the mobile engineering tech leads. It didn't take long for them to let me know the results of my on-campus interview, but it took a really long to setup the next interview.In my Skype interview with the mobile engineering team, the interviewer saw I had a background in computer networking as well, so he asked few questions in the area and also asked me some Java-specific questions. Then he asked me a more involved coding question which I coded in an online code-sharing page.After that, it took a while for TripAdvisor to respond with my results and invite me to an onsite interview at their Newton office (also took a while to reschedule the onsite and also to reschedule it around all the other company onsite interviews I had). The onsite interview could've provided more information as to the schedule of the day, but it was adequate enough that I knew where to when and where to go.During my onsite interview, I interviewed with two hiring managers and one tech lead. Onsite, all my interviewers were very nice. I was asked all technical coding questions and some behavioural questions. They were very interested to know what I wanted to work on if I was hired, which was a refreshing change from other companies where I was told I wouldn't have any say and I would be placed wherever needed more engineers. One of the hiring managers took me to the catered lunch in the cafeteria and I had the chance to hangout with the team and eat lunch. I also received a short tour of the office before lunch. I was supposed to interview with the Mobile engineering director last, but he was on vacation, so it was postponed to the following week over Skype.After that, TripAdvisor was very quick with their responses. In my Skype interview with the engineering director, he was very friendly and I was questioned another technical coding question. I finished the coding question and we talked about the solution and the time/space complexities. He basically said I was hired and the only thing left to do was for me to interview with Andy, who was the senior VP of engineering at TripAdvisor.Even though all my previous interviews with TripAdvisor had gone well, my interview with Andy was pretty tough. He asked me more knowledge based questions and I didn't answer any questions correctly, but seems as though he was more interested in my thought process.The following Monday (I interviewed with Andy on a Wednesday, two days before my first final exam), I received an email from my recruiter saying they were going to give me an offer. We set up a time to discuss the offer. When my recruiter called and told me the offer, I accepted without negotiating since it was very competitive offer.",

However, was in general nice and polite.In the second interview there was also no questions to my CV. It consisted of only one programming task, more difficult than the previous one.The programming task was like this: Travel alerts are displayed on the TripAdvisor website for a given region (e.g. Japan could show that there is earth quake etc.). Implement the findBestTravelAlert method (interview pasted some template code in the online whiteboard).Once code was done. There was some follow-up questions like:- What is the complexity of the code you have written- How can you optimize? how can you optimize it even further.After a week later I got an email saying they would not continue the interview process.

It was basic \"build a b-tree\" type questions and that was it.I should have known that it was going to be a bad day when I showed up and my name was misspelled on the folder they gave me. I was escorted to a small office for the interviews. In between interviews I had to sit there for about 20-30 minutes while I waited for the next interviewer. This happened between all four interviews. The HR rep occasionally stopped in and told me \"we haven't forgotten about you\". One interviewer was very disrespectful because he was playing on his iPhone while I was doing my technical exercises on the whiteboard. I also waited after the fourth interviewer for another half hour while I waited for the last interviewer who never showed up and I was told by the HR person that \"he was too busy to do this\" and that was it. The interview process started at 9:30 and ended at 4:00 and there was no break for lunch. I know companies don't have to provide lunch but you would think that they would at least give you a half hour to go out and grab a bite.

Throughout the whole process I was forced to solve brainteasers and white-board problems for EVERY person I spoke with. Furthermore, some puzzles had no solution (according to the interviewer), others had nothing to do with software development.Throughout the entire\u2026\u00a0 process I was constantly reminded what a great company they were, how many brilliant people worked there, and what a huge favor they were doing me by letting my talentless self interview there.After going through 7 or 8 interviewers over the course of two sessions, I got an offer, which was far lower than what I asked for. When I politely declined, their head of technical recruiting (not going to name him but there is only one) proceeded to insult me and try to strong-arm me into taking their offer - incredibly unprofessional. Needless to say I still declined. That was 2010.I have recently talked to them again - a face-to-face with a hiring manager. While he was fully aware of the offer they have given me in the past, he still proceeded to give me a whiteboard problem and after I solved it, proceeded to tell me that I would have to go through the whole interview process from scratch again and that my added experience didn't matter and they will still only consider me for the same position as they had 2 years earlier. After that, I had a brief chat with the same technical recruiter, who insulted me the last time and who apparently still works there. He proceeded to project the same smug attitude and I left with a bad taste in my mouth. Needless to say, I will not have anything to do with this company ever again. Your mileage may vary, but I did not get an impression that they have a good idea about how to attract quality engineers and I would not want to work there.",

The interviewer asked me about SQL syntax, which I felt was not a good estimate of my programming skills. The second part, OOP design, was very difficult: implement a version control system. I totally blew this problem because I was overwhelmed by the\u2026\u00a0 complexity of a VCS (I use Git, so I was thinking about Git the entire time), and was not able to focus on the bare minimum components that made a VCS work. There were few hints. The questions were harder than my Google interview questions. I consider them very difficult for the entry level job I intend to interview for. Maybe there are people fresh out of college capable of answering those questions, but they certainly will not end up being at TripAdviser.",

The first day of interviews were all with peers and hiring manager, and were mostly technical interviews. The second day was spent with potential colleagues, director and VP of engineering, and of course the\u2026\u00a0 hiring manager, and were much less technical and focused on their development practice and philosophy.The people are very friendly, smart and motivated, and the overall atmosphere is relaxed. It feels like a great place to work.",
