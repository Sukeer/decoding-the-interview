Scheduled a chat with the recruiter and went over the position and interview process (1-2 phone screens, depending on performance, and an onsite).Had my phone interview a week after that with two engineers (one shadowing, who didn't contribute to the interview). We spent the first 10 minutes or so chatting about the work we've been\u2026\u00a0 doing at our respective companies and after that, he gave me a CTCI-type question (although not one directly from the book). I came up with and coded a slightly inefficient solution in about ten minutes, did a space and runtime analysis, and spent the rest of the time optimizing it. The interviewer was friendly and encouraging and gave hints when I got stuck and we eventually arrived at the optimal solution. The interviewer was not too concerned with running code (it's easy to get tripped up on random compiler errors in that sort of environment) and mainly seemed to care about the algorithm. He ended the interview by asking \"Why Uber?\" and opened up the last five minutes to questions.The recruiter was very prompt and got back to me a couple hours later with next steps and we scheduled an onsite for a week and a half later. She was also open to giving feedback when I asked for more info on things I could improve on for the onsite.The onsite included five sections: one hiring manager, one coding, one software design, one architecture, and one Uber culture. All interviews started out with around 10 minutes of introductions and ended with 5 minutes of open Q&A. Every section, with the exception of system architecture, included coding on the whiteboard. Since this was my first interview and I had no idea what to expect with design and architecture, I struggled a lot during those sections. When I admitted I didn't have much experience or familiarity with certain topics during those interviews, the interviewers tended to drill down into those areas and expected me to make educated guesses (despite not having anything on which to base those educated guesses). One interviewer also seemed to get impatient when I tried to ask clarifying questions and continuously 'dumbed' down the original question or interrupted me when I tried to reason things out. By the end of the day, I was feeling pretty exhausted and discouraged and tilted on a relatively simple recursive problem that I figured out after walking out of the building.The recruiter got back to me less than a week after that with feedback and a rejection.",

I double checked with the recruiter\u2026\u00a0 and the recruiter said yes, this will be a pure frontend interview. And I spent days preparing for the frontend interview.At that day, a interviewer called my phone, after a brief introduction of herself, then we proceed to the coding part. I past a chunk of json object and description and asked me to implement it. First of all, why are we doing algorithm question on codepen.io?????Secondly, codepen.io was buggy, as soon as I shrunk the UI display part, part of the description was gone. I refreshed my window, and got the message saying that the room has exceeded the maximum amount of people allowed. I asked the interviewer, and she said that she doesn't know what to do. After minutes of trying, we moved on to using jsfiddle collaborate, which also a poor choice for algorithem based coding. The interviewer were moving her mouse around for the entire time. It was extremely distracting and rude, but I got distracted a lot as her mouse constantly stayed on my code and I had to scroll around to see my coding. That distracted me a lot. Secondly, There was no way to really debug and code on jsfiddle collaborate, as there were tons of exceptions/errors flowed into the console at any given time, which were extremely distracting as well.The interviewer also threw me off multiple times. She said things like: why you use dfs or bfs (which is perfectly fine)? Then she asked whether we should use stack or queue for bfs and dfs? I said that for bfs we should use queue and dfs we should use stack. Then she said no, we should we stack for dfs and queue for bfs. Excuse my accent, but that's exactly what I said, then I repeated myself, and she said no again. Even though I said exactly what she said. Then I have to specifically said depth first search and breadth first search to stop her confusing my pronunciation of \"B\" and \"D\".Once I was close to complete with my implementation, she said that can't you just return results directly within your recursion when there is clearly no way to do so, which threw me off again.A non-stop interruptions and distracted phone screen experience.But I admitted that I didn't perform well on the phone. I am actually doing better in person.Redid the problem and complete it in 10 minutes after phone. Anyway, I blamed myself not able to perform on the phone.",

I've learned quite a lot about Uber and it was pretty cool. I think I did pretty well\u2026\u00a0 but there were a couple if hiccups, especially at the end of the day when I got tired. Also, I might have asked too many questions about Uber's work-life balance :) So next day I was told that I am not a good fit for Uber.However, my good impression about the interviewing process and the team was undermined by what happened next.I interviewed at HQ and they gave me a promotional code so I can use Uber to get there from south bay area. The code didn't work so I just used my credit card to pay for the rides to and from Uber. The recruiter onsite told me to submit the expenses and they would reimburse that. Their form says it takes 15 days to get the money back but I haven't heard from them for about 40 days already. And the most disappointing thing is that the recruiters just ignore my emails.Common, Uber you got more than $6B in funding, I am sure you can afford being honest to your promises :)",

I did some coding questions on my laptop.5) Wrap up with my recruiter.All questions are reasonable. Marked the interview as difficult in the sense that you definitely want to be well prepared. There were quite a few problems I never saw before. Know your stuffs well -- you should be OK.The interview process is very smooth. I have no issue with my onsite travel reimbursement, although it took ~3 weeks to get it completed.I got a call in the next one or two days after my onsite with an offer! The package is excellent.

I then had a third phone\u2026\u00a0 interview scheduled with the recruiter. Over the course of the next week, the recruiter changed the time and manager on me five times before settling down on a date and person. By the time the third interview rolled around, I got called by a manager who wasn't the one I was scheduled to talk to. This manager seemed unprepared and was unaware of the position I wanted to take at the company (mobile development, more geared towards UI). This manager completely dismissed my design work and delved straight into a machine learning question (i never stated i had experience in this field). I was asked a few questions about how to improve an aspect of the Uber service. I responded with some naive answers about device-device communications, to which he shot down immediately and went deep into a machine learning topic.The next day I was informed they would pick a different candidate.",

In fact, the next time I checked my phone after doing the screen I was already invited to an onsite.On site i had 5 interviews. Overall, the interviews were much more about high level process and thinking than coding proper. Other reviews I read, and the recruiters email, prepared me to code on my computer (and again having access to documentation if needs be). In total, I had 2 functional brainstorming sessions ie how would you solve this problem - with problems squarely in my specialty. I had other exercises where I was asked the same but with a technical problem that was pretty different from what I usually do, and for which I had to write pseudocode (on white board). In my first interview, I had some trivial coding questions. I also had a more discussion type interview about values, past experience, etc. I must say it's not easy to get a sense of what are uber values/culture from the website. So I just tried to be true to myself and show what I do care about.My last interview had more classic interview problems on white board. I did 3 exercises which were mostly on the fine points of javascript syntax and structure. Those were not easy especially towards the end of the day.All in all I was surprised that questions stayed mostly high level, that made me more comfortable as I feel strongest there.",

        "details": "I was contacted by a recruiter asking me to interview. In the initial phone screen we spoke for 30 minutes about my resume and they emailed that day to ask for a follow up with a technical person over the phone.The phone interview was an hour long collaborative coding session with a programmer who asked me to solve a sorting problem. It wasn\u2019t difficult and we talked about the solution\u2026\u00a0 while I was coding. The focus was on me having something that compiled and ran. He was enthusiastic and polite. It was a positive experience.I was asked to come in for a longer interview of 4 technical parts and a meeting with one of the managers. I was asked to bring a laptop, but I don\u2019t have one so we organised that they would provide one preloaded with an IDE for coding.For each technical part there were two interviewers. Each started the same \u2013 they introduced themselves and asked a generic \u201ctell us what you\u2019ve been doing?\u201d I was surprised none of them asked specifics about my resume, knew what I\u2019d been working on, or drilled down into anything I said. I got the impression none of them had seen my resume and didn\u2019t care about previous experience. Given that, I wish I had paid more attention to the time and prepared an elevator pitch about myself so that I could have spent more time focused on the technical part.It was immediately obvious that in many cases the interviewers had no idea how to conduct an interview either solo or with a colleague. I was frequently given conflicting instructions from the two interviewers, or told to ignore something the other had said and answer a different question instead. At times they talked insistently and loudly over the top of each other.For the coding session despite organizing to have a laptop waiting for me it wasn\u2019t provided and the interviewer strongly rebuked me for not having brought my own. When I mentioned organizing one with the recruiter they knew nothing about it. I ended up coding on the interviewer\u2019s laptop in a basic text editor on an unfamiliar keyboard. There was no focus on actual output at all and I couldn\u2019t spend much time sitting down writing code because I kept being asked to answer questions on the whiteboard.In a later session I was asked the question and started brainstorming a solution with some pseudo-code on the whiteboard. I was instantly rebuked \u201cwhat do you think you\u2019re doing? You\u2019re not going to be able to solve this using a function.\u201d Later while I was working through the code I mentioned an edge case to check and the interviewers were lost why you should check at all, then got annoyed when I explained that checking edge cases was something you should do.There was a consistent theme of elitism and \u201cwe know better than you\u201d with the interviewer\u2019s attitudes. One person introduced himself with just \u201cHi. I\u2019ve been on this team for 6 months. Before this I was at Google.\u201d Another made sure to mention the Ivy League college they\u2019d attended.My last session was 1:1 . After \"tell me what you\u2019ve been doing?\u201d he asked \u201cwhy do you want to work at Uber?\u201d I started to talk about things I\u2019d been doing at my current job and how I was no longer challenged. He interrupted me with a disgusted look. \u201cI asked *why you want to work at Uber*, not *why you don\u2019t want to work at your current workplace*\u201d. I explained I was doing that and continued with how from my experiences I had learned I was interested in things like cutting edge tech, big data, etc. and I felt I could get that at Uber. I talked about how I like what they do and how great it is. He then deadpanned \u201cso I\u2019m getting you like technology, and you like Uber.\u201d I was a little stunned at his attitude, but I honestly believe they have a great product so I elaborated more on why I thought Uber was doing good things. He tried to justify his question, \u201cI\u2019m an engineering manager and my success is based on the success of my team members, so I want to know what\u2019s going to keep you here in 4 years\u2019 time?\u201d I was confused so I asked \u201c4 years?\u201d He said \u201cyes, what\u2019s to stop you from just packing up and leaving in 4 years\u2019 time?\u201d I wondered if he was being deliberately difficult in order to see how I would react. After explaining I didn\u2019t know what he was implying he asked if I had any questions for him. I asked several in-depth questions about the work they were doing, technical aspects, etc. but he was done and just wanted to leave. He turned side on to me and faced the door, kept looking at his watch and out the window and giving short, dismissive answers. The recruiter turned up slightly after that and he left.During the day, no one said to me \u201chere\u2019s why we want you to come work here and where we see you contributing\u201d. No one said \u201chere\u2019s why you should be here instead of Amazon, or Google, or Facebook\u201d, and no one said \u201cwe have a great team here, it\u2019s an amazing environment and we love working here every day\u201d.

Even to a point of sighing out loud in frustration. Uber expressed that the interview was to simulate a regular work day, and in my opinion this would have been unprofessional in a meeting, but maybe at Uber this is normal? My opinion may also stem from the fact that I have never worked at start ups with a very young engineering culture.I was excited to be given the chance to interview at Uber but after the interview it was clear I didn't fit in with the culture.",

I'll try to be as informative as possible though.Was referred by a buddy to his team, and the initial process took a little longer (about two weeks) partly due to the recruiter not reaching out immediately and that I put things off since I was busy\u2026\u00a0 during that period of time.The phone interview was on filling in code for an existing interface in the mobile framework, which is a not the easiest thing to do since we rely heavily on the editor to auto complete most of the time. The interviewwe was very nice and didn't dwell too much on syntax. The interviewer went into a deeper discussion about the code I just wrote, including why I think the framework was implemented the way it was, and various follow up questions about this particularly feature. The interviewer was quite helpful and offered more detailed explanations of the answers he was looking for throughout the interview.A day later the recruiter called with positive feedback and wanted to to move to onsite. I was given options of completing a coding challenge at home or onsite (an easier version of the take home I assume). I chose the take home for obvious reasons, but told him that I was going be very busy over the next few days. I eventually around to it and spent about 4-5 hours on it before submitting, after which I was knocking my head on the wall after realizing I had bugs and what not. Also I was unsure of how polished it was suppose to be, and tried to adhere to the 4 hour guideline, which we all know is not a lot of time to do anything. Two days later the recruiter called back to move onto the onsite. The feedback was that overall I did well on the coding challenge, with some problems (e.g. not demonstrating understanding of MVC, bugs, etc), but those problems will be addressed once I go in person.Interviewees are given $200 in Uber credits to get to and from the interview, which I didn't use as it wasn't enough giving the limitations. Once there, I was put into a room (which every interview complained to be very cold) for 5 one-hour interviews. Compared to other interviews I've done in the past, I felt that the Uber interview was the most effective at gauging the domain knowledge as well as programming skills of a candidate , as opposed to most other places where the questions asked are not relevant to the domain, and in the case of places like Google, completely not related to one's expertise. During the interviews, I was asked to:1) fix bugs and add to the project I submitted for the coding challenge, and defend my implementation with a bunch of follow up questions related to optimization2) answer a ton of questions on the mobile framework that tested for both breadth and depth of knowledge (not sure how I came up with some of those answers)3) code algorithm involving implementation and use of two data structures (was unfamiliar with the second one and had to figure it out on the spot)4) OOP design question (hardest one for me by far as the interviewer wanted a completely modularized design)5) design discussion (very interesting as the interview was a debate and I wasn't sure what the interviewer was looking for)One day later, the recruiter called to make an offer.I want to mention that the Uber recruiter was very professional and moved very fast (This is not true in many case elsewhere). Useful feedback was also given that allowed me to better prepare for the next stage. I was very satisfied working with him and at no point in time felt I like I was left hanging.",

        "details": "I interviewed a few months ago for a full time software engineer position at Uber. I got the interview opportunity through friend referral.I was first scheduled for one round of phone screening that was given by an engineering manager of Uber. Was asked about my technical background, my work, as well as two coding problems. It went very well and I was invited for onsite interview one hour after the\u2026\u00a0 phone call.The onsite interview occurred 2 weeks later and last about 4.5 hours. 4 people challenged me with many technical questions such as whiteboard coding and system design questions. Every one was pretty friendly and walked in quite on time so there was not much break time in between. Last technical interview was a practical one - I was asked to solve a real world problem and implemented it subsequently. Before the actual coding work, interviewer had a thorough discussion with me on details of all levels to make sure it was a reasonable solution that could be done in a matter of minutes. The problem wasn't super hard and the solution could be suboptimal but you need to make it work. Therefore you better be a hands-on engineer at work and write real code in an efficient way (editor choice, API lookup, debugging skills, etc). For myself I use Vim everyday and that helped me a lot. Following the 4th round of technical interview I also got the chance to talk to recruiter and hiring manager for various questions and concerns, which they addressed very well.I got an offer next day after the onsite interview which after some negotiation I happily accepted. One thing I'd like to point out is that I was blown away by the company's efficiency during the whole hiring process. The hiring manager and a few recruiters I worked with always responded very promptly within a few minutes. BTW I live in South bay and the commuting to/from San Francisco was of course covered using Uber, making the interview experience even more pleasant:)",

She told me that I was not a fit because the team was looking for a very specific candidate.In hindsight, the statement from the recruiter and from some other reviewers cannot be more true: the company is looking for VERY SPECIFIC skill set and is not looking for anything remotely like a generalist. The position I applied for was in mapping and logistics and they seem to expect me to know all the algorithms in computational geometry. My friends who were hired by a different team in the company was hired because he knew exactly what the team was looking for. It looks like people were hired to solve problems that already have and not the ones that will come up in the future.In other words, the company's hiring demeanor is very short sighted.",

Worked on this over the weekend (I found it really fun to do actually) and sent it over on monday.Tuesday I had a interview scheduled - they knew I was taking a plane Friday, so they happily scheduled the itw on Thursday.Spend about 4 hours there, split in 4 interviews of different types.

I might have performed better at the interview if I didn't have to admit so many areas for improvement in my submission. Had I been aware that my code would be part of the interview, I probably would have done a better job. This is something to be aware of because they failed to mention it prior to my submission.Otherwise, the interviews were tough and tiring. The questions were somewhat less structured than many other companies.The office seemed quite disorganized. I doubt it's always like that, but it did appear that I was invited at an especially hectic time, both at the office and in the neighborhood outside. I might have benefited from them inviting me at a more reasonable time. The recruiter had rushed me through the whole process. Maybe I would have been more prepared if I hadn't allowed this to happen.Finally, they repeatedly volunteered to pay to reimburse my transportation costs and then failed to do so. It wasn't a significant amount, but it was more than I have spent anywhere else. The only reason I splurged was that, with no suggestion of my own, the recruiter volunteered to cover the costs multiple times. Of course, after I was rejected I was not reimbursed.

Then had a phone call with the hiring manager before coming in for four onsite interviews. The interviewers all spent a good amount of time getting to know me before moving on to the technical portion, which was mostly coding on a whiteboard. Things were a bit hectic\u2026\u00a0 when I interviewed - Uber had outgrown the office and interviews were done in a quiet corner. Also, the list of interviewers changed quite a bit. Another notable thing was Uber was the only company that asked how I handle stress. All signs of rapid growth, but not necessarily a bad thing.",

Note that I had to book my own flight\u2026\u00a0 and hotel and I didn't get reimbursed until two weeks later. Not a big deal but be prepared to front about $1,000 if you're coming from the east coast on such short notice.The onsite wasn't very organized, people stepped in and out. I met with all engineers (besides a brief chat with the recruiter), in total about 8 - 10 people. I know for a fact I didn't do well on one interview. The interviewer had a very strong European accent and I also answered one of his questions wrong. He even laughed at me, which I thought was extremely rude. I did well on all the other interviews throughout the day.A week later I got a rejection email saying that they liked my passion but didn't think I had enough Python experience. Very much a canned rejection email.",

She passed me off to another recruiter who set me up with a call with the hiring manager.Call with hiring manager mostly covered non-technical topics, largely about how my speciality might fit\u2026\u00a0 in at Uber. After that I had an onsite interview scheduled.The onsite was a technically rigorous interview with three sessions, it reminded me of the Google style interview process. Some whiteboard coding, lots of discussions about how my speciality could fit in at Uber and a lot of sysadmin style technology questions. Everyone I met was really pleasant and very smart.I got a call just under a week later saying that they I had done well but weren't convinced that I had demonstrated sufficient software engineering skills (outside my speciality) and asked if I could do a take home coding test. I finished the test in a handful of hours over two evenings and got it back to them. From the sounds of things the code test normally happens before the onsite interview. A few days after that I heard that they wanted to make an offer.At this point I was also waiting for an offer from another company and told them so and asked for some time. The recruiter was happy to give me time to consider other offers and went through the offer in some detail. The offer was a good (but not amazing) salary plus stock options, the stock options were worth almost as much as the salary at the present valuation of the company (according to the recruiter).The story takes an unexpected detour here as my other offer is delayed due to problems at the other company. The recruiter was very understanding but grew a little frustrated as the delay turned into a multiple week saga. Eventually the other company made an offer that had a similar salary component but a much larger equity component. It was a hard choice but I was more interested in the market segment of the other company so I declined Uber's offer.Everyone I met at Uber was great and I would have been delighted to work there.",
