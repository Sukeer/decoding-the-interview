It was an awesome experience to solve the problems and they were very helpful throughout the procedure. Didn't get the offer, but would definitely love to try again after 6 months.",

        "details": "I'm a university student. First applied through Amazon.job in mid October, got an email from a college hiring team a month later saying that they'd like to move forward to the interview process for the position at Seattle, WA (although here they mentioned it's at the headquarter, it still depends on your preference and their availability to put you into one of the offices across north america.) Sent some personal\u2026\u00a0 info and got an email that has a link to an online assessment site. The test was easy, only contains several debugging questions. You can run the code and see the results in the online IDE. Basic debugging skills are enough (try first output the result, you will most likely find the bug right away if you see the result. If you are using C or Java, printf or println would come in handy here if you struggle finding the bugs). Three weeks after the assessment (it was around Christmas holidays, so it should take less than 2 weeks.) got another email from a recruiter, asking for availability to schedule a phone interview. Wanted to conduct it through skype or google hangouts but they insisted doing it via a cellphone or landline. Phone reception sucks in my apartment so just bought a skype number for a few bucks and gave them the skype number. I'm majoring in CS, already started to prepare for coding interviews since 2nd year, coded most questions in Cracking The Coding Interview, and also applied to other companies like google, fb, microsoft. The questions are at the same level as those of google or fb. Definitely not difficult to think of, but it requires some coding skills. Detailed strategy depends on your interviewer, if your interviewer wants you to talk, then try to talk while you are thinking before start coding. Remember to ask your interviewer if he or she wants you to talk more or code quick. The interview went pretty good. Got enough time for two questions. The first one was just a tree question from cracking the coding interview. Some details were changed but main idea remains same. After coding the first question, still got about 20+ mins. The interviewer asked a 2nd question and stressed that it's a bonus question and I dont have to code it, just want me to give him a basic idea. The question was surprisingly easy though, still a data structure problem, main idea is to use tries. After briefly explaining my idea, I started to code it. Finished coding and got 5 mins to ask the interviewer some questions. I asked some pretty damn stupid questions and was worring that I would lose the offer just because of these stupid questions. Only made a small mistake in the 2nd question, realized it right away. was able to code the first question perfectly without any mistakes. This is important. Do not make too many small mistakes or it's just not likely that you would get an offer. Luckily got the offer after one week, best moment in my life.",

        "details": "Was contacted by their recruiter. The process took approx. 2-3 weeks.After a short intro call I was scheduled for an online test on HackerRank. Then there was a tech screening: I was asked to code on a shared screen while being on the phone. Finally I was invited for an onsite. The actual position was in NYC, but the interview took place in Seattle.In a prep call I was asked\u2026\u00a0 if I'm aware that it's a front-end position. I was a little surprised, because my resume, and the skills I listed in the questionnaire that I was given, clearly said back-end. Maybe it's their process, or there was some sort of a mixup. The job description just said SDE. Anyway it was late to back down after all the pre-screen trials. I did my share of front-end to a reasonable extent, I always considered working at Amazon and I wanted see what's next, so I went in anyway.The hotel was right in the downtown of Seattle and the accommodation was great. I went on campus the next morning and met with around 7 or 8 people in total, 1-2 at a time in a conference room where I spent most of the day. The interview lasted 5 hours plus lunch at the local bistro. Basically there's just you, the interviewer(s) and a whiteboard for your layouts and code. Some of the questions were basic, but then they slowly rose in difficulty. Some of the questions were very front-end specific.I was very nervous and it was quite challenging to dig the memory, track the time and maintain focus at the same time. The interviewers were nice and helpful. At the end of each hour I was offered to ask my questions. They gladly answered questions about the company and the product, but none of the interviewers answered any direct question about the role, which I found a little disturbing. Also all of the interviewers were from different groups. It felt more as if I'm being showcased to different teams to see who wants to pick me rather than being screened for a specific role that I was applying to.I was polite and patient, but I can't say it was a very pleasant experience, and it took some time to recover from. However, I wouldn't mind trying again being better prepared.",

Since I had applied to two teams there were two manager interviews and 4 technical interviews.\u2026\u00a0 They really hammered me with behavioral questions (\"Tell me about a time when...\"). I could see this getting exhausting if I wasn't expecting it. I definitely recommend jotting down more than one example for each of the Amazon leadership principles. They didn't ask about them directly but most questions were probing in the direction of one or more. Even the technical interviewers ask these kinds of questions. They are definitely looking to see if I would fit in with the Amazon culture as much as whether I was technically qualified. Everyone was extremely nice and obviously competent making the experience much less stressful than it could have been.I got the offer the next day via a recruiter e-mail and phone call. Over the next couple weeks the hiring managers and recruiters kept in constant contact. I met with the managers again in a less formal setting.

        "details": "Pretty standard interview process with an assortment of technical and behavioral interviews on-site. From what I observed, unlike any other company which nitpicks people from a group of interviewees, AWS has many positions than they could interview for. All one has to do is surpass their minimum bar*.I had 6 back to back interviews without any break. Even lunch is an interview, where I decided not to continue my lunch\u2026\u00a0 after getting carried with the interviewer's questions :D (He is a great guy). My advice is to prepare yourselves by training for 5-6 hour long sprints without any breaks, at least the week before interviews. Because, the real challenging interview is the final bar-raiser. Until then, it was all fun, but I'm totally tired by this interview.The bar raiser:I was interviewed by two people, one being the active interviewer (in training) and the other being a proctor (This guy didn't talked a word in the entire interview). I was asked a dynamic programming problem, directly from CTCI's hard problems. But I hadn't looked at it before (realized it was from CTCI after interviews), and had trouble figuring it out. He provided some hints, some in the wrong direction, but I was so tired and couldn't think much better than brute force solution. In the last 2 minutes, I figure out the solution and provided a gist, but the hiring manager has been waiting outside, and the interview has to be called off before they could ask any questions about my approach.Overall, the interview process is really good, and faster than any other company. Recruiters can be slow, but once you are streamlined for onsite interviews, everything moves so quickly. They should also provide hiring decision in less than a week time. Unfortunately, I didn't made it, which I'm sure is for performance in bar raiser (After self analysis, I thought I wouldn't hire myself, if I'm the hiring manager). But the hiring manager is very positive, and guaranteed to provide another interview after 6 months. We are in touch through LinkedIn.Here is what I think could be a road map for successful interview at Amazon (or any others):1. At least 6 months of strong practice (3 - 4 hours a day) in Data Structures, Algorithms and Problem Solving.2. Attention to detail, flexible in solving incoming problems on the fly (The inteviewer can dramatically change the problem structure on the fly), thinking of all test cases and corner cases before saying done.3. Sources like CTCI, GeeksForGeeks.org, LeetCode are really helpful in developing general problem solving skills.",

If you finish those, you should get to next level.If you clear this, then you get to second online test.around 2.5 hrs..two stages..first stage is work simulation.. so you will ideally feel that you are working from home..operational stuff..just pay attention to details and chats..Second stage is two programs in 1 hour. If you get the logic, then it won't take more than 20 minutes to solve..I panicked initially but was able to finish it in 30 minutes...once you run the code, test cases are evaluated against it...make sure to pass all test cases...If this goes well, then you are called to seattle for onsite interview...this was the best interview experience for me so far...they don't grill you whole day with standard algorithmic questions and try to judge you..anyone with good memory can clear it...what they do is divide candidates in a team of 3.

        "details": "Onsite at Houston, there were 4 technical interviews in front of a whiteboard. Good mix of questions. Got a call back saying that the bar raiser thought I'd be good for a management role so I did a phone interview for that but I had a very hard time understanding the interviewer because of his Indian accent. I found a decent solution to the programming question in that interview but\u2026\u00a0 was told I was not going to be offered the management position but would be offered an SDE position, the recruiter talked about compensation but would not mention a base salary, only total compensation package, which is fine, but I make my decisions on my known budget and if I can afford rent in the location. Then I heard nothing for several days and was finally passed to another Amazon recruiter. She said that I had a phone call with a team manager to see if it was a good fit, she specifically said it would not be technical that I had allready passed all that. The phone call started out with very bad feedback, the interviewer was using some software that made an echo of everything I said. It was very disorientating to be talking about my past projects but hear my voice repeat. He turned whatever it was off then then drilled into one project in particular in an area that I had said I didn't setup. Then asked an algorithm question, which I found a medium level solution for. It was very adversarial feeling. Very strange company that they state that hiring is there number one focus. I think not hiring is really there number one goal, because after that call the recruiter said she was confused by what happened as well and said she'd try me with 2 more teams for a fit. It's been 4 days since she said that so I've pretty much written them off. No one that I've talked to seems to be a decision maker, if a company makes a verbal offer and says over and over that they want to hire you, why not just finalize it and figure out placement later.Company seems great if you know what your getting into, but the hiring process seems convoluted.",

I took the Algorithms class on coursera (they offer two sequential classes). That was probably one of the most helpful things. Those classes go over exactly what you need to know - data structures, algorithms, etc. They didn't ask me directly about the data structures (i.e. What is a hash table?) but I did need to know exactly what my options were and the properties of each data structure. For each problem, I had to choose which structures were appropriate and explain why. So I had to know them inside and out. I would strongly recommend going through all the common data structures and refreshing how they work, what they are best for, and the complexity of each operation.I would also suggest learning about Amazon specifically - what their teams do, what languages and database systems they use. I did, so I was able to ask my interviewers good questions.During the interview, I was extremely nervous but I made sure to talk through everything I was doing and thinking about even if I didn't have a solution in mind right away.

I still don't know where they got my resume; but I assume it was from when I applied for a co-op position a year before. I was excited to go, but from the very start I got the impression it was going to be tough. I got an email about a\u2026\u00a0 week beforehand with about 8 attachments containing literature about the company. I was informed that I would be doing a programming problem for most of the day, and I would have my choice of language, compiler, and OS.When I arrived on campus, we were given visitor badges and told to wait until someone came to get us. I felt weird that the majority (at least 75%) of interviewees were foreign students. It made me feel like I was out of my league. We were taken upstairs to a conference room where HR gave a speech about how great the company is. We were then assigned to a table, and given a laptop and packet describing the programming challenge. The challenge was supposed to be team-based (with the people at your table), but it turned out to be more individual that I anticipated. The problem broke into three pieces, and each person picked a part to do. You didn't have to use the same language. The parts were basically independent, but I could see where sharing code between teammates could be helpful.We were given 6 hours to complete the task. After about half an hour, an engineer came to gauge our understanding of the problem, and clarified anything we didn't know. We then worked for about an hour, and an engineer pulled each of us out for a personal \"interview\". It was the least personal interview I have ever had. The engineer was all business, and we just talked about my approach to the problem. When I got back, I had about 4 more hours to complete the assignment. Half an hour before the deadline, we were individually interviewed again. Pretty much the same type of thing, just talked about my approach. The interviewers were always interested in efficiency. They asked questions like \"how could you make this better/faster\", and \"why did you use this data structure\".I really got bit in the butt because I was forced to use C++, instead of C (which I am much more familiar with). I was unfamiliar with the C++ libraries, and I had to waist a lot of time looking at documentation. BIG TIP: be very familiar with your language before you go!My solution was incomplete, and I knew this when I turned in. I was encouraged to write a README file which explained my shortcomings, and any ideas I had to make the code more efficient.At the end of the interview, we had a group Q&A with a developer. I got the impression that this was a very stressful job with poor work/life balance. I love the area, so if I had gotten an offer it would have been a tough decision weather I was willing to sacrifice a stressful job for my dream city.",

        "details": "I was recruited via Linkedin and invited to two rounds of phone interviews before being invited to an onsite interview in Seattle. Because I have signed a non-disclosure agreement so I can reveal the actual question. However, both phone interviews last about 90 min each and both have about 30 min to cover your background and career interest, about 10 min for my questions and the rest are technical questions.\u2026\u00a0 Technical questions aren't terribly difficult but you do have to brush up your college data structure. The real tricky part is you need to log in to an online whiteboard or you to demonstrate your coding solution. The whiteboard actually has a simplified IDE that can compile most of the common programming language. The interviewer from my second phone interview doesn't care too much about the actual compilation but the one from the first is a bit more particular on that. So if you are expecting just pseudo-coding you might be surprised.Regarding the on-site interview there are about five different sessions, each last about 50 minutes. All except one are one-on-one, the other have two interviewer. The questions can be divided into three categories 1) projects you have done before 2) behavioral questions and 3) technical questions. For category 1, they might concentrated on a certain project in your resume when going over your previous experience, so picking the right experience to prepare for interviewed will certainly help. There are plenty example online for category 2. For the technical questions, they are more or less the same as the phone interview, except you only need to do pseudo-code. They are mildly challenging and it shouldn't be overly difficult as long as you are reasonably apt at problem solving. The part I dislike the most is one of the interview session is done over lunch, so the interviewer will take me out to lunch and at the same time asking me questions. The Amazon facility in Seattle are right in downtown so my interviewer are juggling between finding the restaurant in the middle of the city, deciding what to eat and interviewing me at the same time. Even worse is a hobo came up to us on the street asking for a quarter for cup of coffee or something like that. So a lot of time the interviewer seemed to be lost in all these and I didn't feel like what I said had actually got through to him at time.Contrary to other's experience, all my interviewers do give me sufficient time to ask questions and I don't feel I was being rushed. However, it doesn't seem like they have a particular position in mind for me to fill, rather they are trying to see if I can be fit into any of their need, so I don't really have a clear idea what position I am actually apply for and thus it is hard to ask sensible questionsAlso they are very responsive throughout the entire interviewing process, most of the time they will get back to me within one day or two between each round.",

        "details": "I was contacted by a recruiter via email to interview for a SDE position during a hiring event in Boston. I had an initial phone call with the recruiter, who put me in touch with a scheduler. The scheduler set me up for a phone interview, which was a live-coding interview.# Phone Interview #There were a few questions about my resume (the one they had was four years out of\u2026\u00a0 date!) but the majority of this interview was technical. The questions were pretty basic and focused on general algorithmic knowledge. I only remember the last task, which involved Fibonacci sequence generation. There were several steps after this that involved optimizing the solution. Once finished, the interviewer gave me a chance to ask questions about Amazon.Shortly after the phone interview, I was contacted by the team recruiter who informed me that they'd like me to come in for an on-site interview. I made a point to discuss my resume being four years out of date, but was told this would not be a problem. I was given a list of times and asked to pick a handful that worked best for me. Once that was taken care of, I was given a rundown of the position (salary range, relocation package, benefits, etc.) Onsite interview specifics were explained to me and the onsite was set to take place a couple weeks later.# Onsite Interview #A schedule was given to me a few days before the onsite interview that outlined who I'd be interviewing with (name and title,) and at what time. The format was 4 interviews at 45 minutes each, all in the same room, all technical in nature. I arrived early, and waited in the lobby for an interviewer to come meet me and take me to the interview room. Once other candidates arrived, there weren't enough chairs for everyone in the lobby, so the receptionist had to run and get some office chairs from somewhere else in the building. After waiting for a short period (maybe 20 or so minutes,) my first interviewer met me in the lobby, got me a visitor badge, and we headed over to the interview room.I won't get specific about the questions from the onsite interview (NDA, more on that later,) but I will say that they follow a basic template. First few questions are scripted behavioral questions, everything else is technical. I was required to write code for every interview (even those with managers.) All of the interviewers were explicitly *not* strict regarding syntax, with the exception of the bar raiser. I was also asked architectural and design questions. I got along well with everyone but the bar raiser, who succeeded in ruffling my feathers a bit. All of the interviews were completed with enough time for me to ask the interviewer questions except for the bar raiser, whose interview I didn't wrap up in time. Every interviewer had my outdated resume and asked me about my experience listed. This meant I had to update each about the last 4 years of my professional life (which contained directly relevant experience.)After the final interview, I was escorted to the elevators after being told multiple times that I'd hear back from someone within 3 days. Overall, the campus felt very sterile and almost prison-like. What I did see of the office was bland and unappealing (no art on the walls, nothing distinguishing peoples' desks, nothing to suggest that people even work there.) I was only ever offered water, and was at no point allowed to go anywhere without a direct escort. Throughout the interviews I did not leave the room, but was asked in between interviews if I needed to use the restroom. I was required to sign an NDA to complete the interview process, but at no point was told what it was I'd actually be working on, despite me directly asking. I was told that even other teams within the company weren't privy to what was going on.As mentioned earlier, I was told that I'd receive either an offer or rejection within 3 days. About a week passed, so I reached out to the recruiters to ask for an update. No response. It wasn't until almost a month after the onsite that I was sent a rejection. The email was pretty off-putting because it was suggested that maybe a support or systems engineering position would be a better fit for me. I was already making a downward move title-wise to the SDE position, but the change of location and project focus were appealing enough to merit that.# Overall #While every person I spoke with was personable and seemed intelligent (without coming off arrogant,) the company bothered me. Amazon seems to be devoid of a culture to the point of feeling robotic. The sterile office, scripted responses, failure to follow through on self-appointed contact deadlines, general lack of input recognition, the mildly insulting rejection quip, and some frustrating logistical blunders (which I won't get into,) all made me think that it's probably best I didn't receive an offer.",

Each interview was roughly the same: do some whiteboard coding, answer questions about your history. None of the whiteboard questions were riddles or tricks\u2026\u00a0 or things with one weird solution that you probably won't come to on your own. They were just mildly thorny problems where a decent solution involves a map or two and updating data in the proper order: decent and realistic stuff.Read up on Amazon's Leadership Principles. There is a lot of \"behavioral interviewing\" where you're asked about challenges you've experienced and how you've responded to them. I went in expecting general questions where they'd analyze my answer to see if it exemplified specific Leadership Principles. In reality, the interviewers just straight-up asked, \"tell me about a time where you <INSERT AMAZON LEADERSHIP PRINCIPAL>\".Where Amazon differed from other companies is that I was not given much opportunity to ask questions of the interviewers. They told me the project is secret and that most projects at Amazon are treated as secrets, even to other employees within the company. It's a little weird not knowing 100% what you're signing up for. Also, I didn't get a good feel for the culture of the team I'd be joining.The whole process took just over a month, which is apparently faster than usual.

So I contacted them by email to ask about the status of my application, and they replied by inviting me for an on-site interview at their Seattle campus. They didn't ask for a phone interview or talk to me before that. I thought that was weird, but cool nonetheless.As it turned out, there was a catch. The reason\u2026\u00a0 they don't do phone interviews is because the on-site interviews are group interviews with about 50 other candidates. And damn they are difficult. They don't have time to do phone interviews, because they are doing it mass production style. Amazon is growing at a very fast pace, and adding a lot of employees constantly, as well as replacing those who leave because of their high turn-over rate. I guess they figured this is the only way that they can hire a lot of people, yet still ensure they are only getting top quality. I would have preferred if it was one-on-one interviews. Even if I hadn't gotten an offer that way, I would have felt more respected.The interview day is comprised of one big programming project. We were given old low-end bulky laptops with small screens (14 inch?) to work on. We worked in groups of three. They constantly stressed that we were not competing with either our teammates or other groups, and that if we were all good, they would hire us all. Given the fast rate at which Amazon is growing, I believe that.I believe the programming project was too big and too time consuming for only about 5-6 hours. I think it favors people with a lot of programming experience rather than problem solving ability. Someone who can crank out a lot of simple code quickly will outperform someone who can write a small amount of really difficult code. I don't think they are necessarily getting the best quality of candidates this way. This is an entry level position, and they shouldn't have interviews more suitable for seasoned software engineers.Amazon admitted that they have a very frugal cost-conscious company culture and this is a good thing. However, I don't like that they downplayed the frequency with which employees are on-call: where they could be called in the middle of the night and have to wake up and fix a site reliability problem, albeit from their home. According to them, it was a few days every six months, but according to someone I know who worked at Amazon, it is a few days every couple of weeks.",

        "details": "Group Coding InterviewI have been called for special round where people from different universities are grouped into a team size of 3. We were given three problems to work on, all of them are independent of each other and will be evaluated only on the performance of the individual. Although, they will assess our team collaboration skills.There is very less information across the web for this Group Interview and it\u2026\u00a0 was very difficult to predict how it going to be and prepare for it. I signed NDA so I cannot reveal the questions but I will give the best information which is not discussed elsewhere.Interview starts at 9:30 AM and you will have some info session with the dev's. You will be given the question at around 10 Am and will have a chance to pick up a task from 3 tasks assigned for the group. The panel will reach to your table at around 10:30-10:45 and will have a 15 min Q&A session on your approach. You will have the chance to code for until 2:00 PM, after which you need to report to the panel about your status for about 15 minutes. Later, 30 min interview very relevant to the coding exercise and a final 15 min session.You need to wrap up things by around 4:30-5 PM. Ultimately, you will be left with 4 - 4:30 hour for the coding exercise.The tasks were not very difficult, you need to think how you can code the solution in 4 hours. It is very important to come up with some working solution rather than a fancy one. I almost came up with a very elegant OO code but failed to finish and make it run. I complicated myself, so are others. I could hardly see anyone turning up a solution.Advice:Prepare well with the data structures, advanced ones like interval trees etc.Have good knowledge about algorithms like Bellman ford, Knapsack and many more.etc.No need to stress on Design Patterns.Collaborate well with the team.Practice some coding challenges which can be solved in 3-4 hours (Most Important).It is all about your thinking process and the speed,accuracy with which you can code.Enjoy Seattle !",

The Amazon interviewers and current developers present there mentioned that the problems were simplified versions of real issues that Amazon\u2026\u00a0 was dealing with. In our team we had to come to an agreement as to which interviewee would take on which problem. After that, you were pretty much on your own to solve the problem. Each interviewee was given a laptop and there were a variety of programming languages and IDEs available and even an Ubuntu VM. I chose Java, NetBeans, and Windows. You should really choose what you are most comfortable with; don't try to improvise there. Unlike white boards interviews, here you had to get an actual program working, pseudo code would not cut it. On the other hand, you had plenty of time to think about your solution, which is not really the case in other 1 on 1 interviews. Common online resources were available (Google, StackOverflow), you just were not allowed to access personal repositories (Dropbox, etc). Every two hours you would stop coding and would explain your thought process to an interviewer for about 30 minutes, analyzing your approach, your reasoning and what you could do to improve your solution. Even if you have no time for a more carefully optimized solution, you should be able to explain in a detailed manner how you would proceed if you had more time and resources (like a database) and why. Your data structure choices and how to use them was very important in order to provide a working source code solution. Be ready to go through the cons of each decision and think about scalability.

The recruiter was always very nice and very helpful; the recruiting people gave me advises and told me what to expect in the interviews and what topics to study, it felt like they were kind of on my side and wanted to help me succeed in the interviews.I first got a phone technical interview that lasted about 30 minutes. They asked\u2026\u00a0 me some general data structures questions and then we used ColabEdit for coding; I just got one single coding problem to solve, they asked me to write function to efficiently look for all the phone numbers from a list A that were part of a list B (I solved it by using a Hash Table and my interviewer was happy with the solution).Then I got a second phone interview. The second interview was very similar to the first one; I got some data structures and algorithms questions and then they gave me another coding problem to solve on ColabEdit, they asked me to write a function that would receive the root of a binary tree as input parameter and would restructure the tree so that the final result was the same tree but vertically mirrored. I wrote a function and my interviewer was happy with it.After the two phone interviews, they asked me to fly to Seattle for the final round of interviews that last the whole day. They put me in a nice hotel and payed for all the expenses. I got 5 interviews in total, each one lasting about 1 hour.First onsite interview: They asked me general questions and asked me to describe some of my past projects; then asked me to design and code a Cache system. They told me they didn't know the right answer and they just wanted to see what I would come up with, they participated in the design suggesting things and asking questions.Second onsite interview: They asked me to create an algorithm to find all the strongly connected components of a graph (very though question in my opinion). Lucky me I had studied some graphs theory and I was able to remember Tarjan's algorithm to find strongly connected components. I reproduced the algorithm from what I remembered and I think I did it right (although some times the interviewers are more interested in seeing how you approach a problem rather than knowing the solution, so not sure if knowing the answer played against me).Third onsite interview: One of the amazon guys took me out for lunch to a place neat place near amazon and we just chatted and towards the end of the interview he started asking me some behavioral questions.Fourth onsite interview: On this one I interviewed with a PM and a leader from one of the Amazon teams. The Amazon team lead asked me to design an eCommers website. I think I struggled a little bit with this one because I was not prepared for architectural questions or designed, I kind of just focused on algorithms.Fifth onsite interview: The last guy just asked me to write some easy code to perform some task that I forgot, but it was very easy.In all the 5 interviews they all asked me behavioral questions related to the Amazon Values (study the Amazon Values, this is extremely important for them).Although I struggled in the third onsite interview, I really felt like my overall performance had been great and I thought I was going to get an offer; but at the end they didn't extend an offer. I asked for some feedback to know what areas I was weak to work on them but they told me that they cannot provide feedback because of their policies.",

These include a detailed discussion on my experience and specifics on projects I worked on (be ready to explain what you did, how, and why you did it), as well as some coding. Amazon seems very interested in understanding the complexity of your work and\u2026\u00a0 how versed you are in sharing those experiences.After these interviews, I was scheduled for an onsite interview at the Seattle HQ. Amazon puts you in contact with a travel desk that arranges your flight and accommodations for you. Feel confident in asking for flights/airlines or other requests you may have, as they are friendly and will try to get what you ask for. Amazon flies you a day before the interview and puts you on a very nice hotel 10 min away from the office.Onsite interview day included five 1:1 interviews, including two development managers and three SDEs, focusing on different areas. You are received by your recruiter and have a 30 min chat with him. You get some details on what to expect during the day, and the days after the interview.Most interviewers will be writing notes while you chat (they ask if you're ok with it - I wonder if you say no, what happens?!). Questions include behavioral and technical, as well as coding on a whiteboard. Interviewers are friendly and help you through the process - ask for what are you thinking and give you hints in case they see you getting stuck. The best way to easy the nerves is to keep talking as you tackle problems. It helps more than what you think.I heard back from my recruiter after 2 days saying the team wanted to move forward and extend an offer. A couple days after I got the details of it and after some light negotiation I accepted.My advise is to avoid focusing too much on the horror stories you find online, and just make the experience your own. It is unlikely you'll get something like you have read here. It will be unique and a good learning experience, whatever the outcome is. Just try to enjoy it as much as you can and please, don't go into it without serious preparation before hand.

The challenge itself was for 2 hours.It had three questions and all you had to do is write the code\u2026\u00a0 (there is no compilation), explain it and also add relevant comments. The questions weren't extraordinarily tough or anything. If you have sound logic and a good grasp of data structures you should be okay.2 weeks later I got an email to attend an onsite interview. The whole process of scheduling a onsite took almost a month. I've heard that it usually doesn't take that long but they probably had many people interviewing.I flew out on a Thursday and was accommodated in a nice hotel quite close to the headquarters. The interview was scheduled to begin at 12:00PM.I made my way to the office and after all of us who had interviews assembled (around 40) we were given temp IDs and taken to a large room with many tables. They asked us to sit in groups of 4 at a table and grab a bite to eat. In a few minutes our interviewers came and joined and everyone had a nice informal chat. After half an hour, names of interviewers and and those people who they will interview were called out. We were taken to our respective rooms and the interview started.As is with many other reviews here, I am not at liberty to disclose what they asked me during the interview.But make sure that you have spent time sitting and writing code by hand on paper or better yet, on a whiteboard.Cracking the coding interview was the only thing I referred to. Solve the book yourself and towards the last chapters you'll realize that breaking down difficult problem comes naturally.I had four back to back interviews. All technical with quite a large amount of coding involved. There were a few random HR questions but mainly coding. There were 2-4 programming questions in each round. One has to explain the logic, write the code and explain his/her logic, prove that the code works run test cases and be ready to tell him/her/them how you would scale that code up in case they ask you.There was no pre defined level to the order of difficulty, I found the first three equally intensive and the fourth one very hard.More stress cannot be laid on the following fact - \"Strict proper coding is of paramount importance\".Just scribbling stuff, writing algorithms will not help you. You are expected to know your stuff.Proper function definitons, variable names, pointer usage (if c/c++).When you test your function make sure that you have thought about EVERY SINGLE edge case under the Sun. You might think that you have covered them all but beware. If I say every possibilty under the sun, I mean under the Sun not only on Earth but also under the sun on Jupiter, Saturn, moon etc.I got stuck at a point where I didn't even have a single line of code on the board.The interviewer did give me a hint after a couple of requests. But be sure that you have thought out (aloud) every other possibility.There is no greater sin that not knowing what space and time complexities are and how to figure out what they are for the algorithm you have come up with.We were done by 5 in the evening on a Friday and I had the offer on Monday.Good luck to anyone reading this!",

All the interviewers seem to like the company, but none of them seem to love it.I got an email offer 2 days after those interviews, and I was also invited to fly to Amazon for a day trip, where I met some of the teams at Amazon and chatted with some engineers. The trip was interesting and I enjoyed it. However, I eventually decided to decline the offer because I don't think I was particularly passionate about any of the teams.Before you go to an Amazon interview, be warned that they will give you an offer very quickly. If you have other companies that you have in mind that you would like to consider, you should set up interviews with them first. I know a lot of people (including myself) who got an unexpectedly early offer from Amazon before they were even contacted by other companies they might like.",

        "details": "I applied online and was contacted by a University recruiter. I had to do a small programming test online (about 90 minutes). It was simple, and you could do your programming in Java or C++. With this online assessment was the usual personality test that comes with job applications. I did not have a phone interview and was invited in about a month later for what I call \"Interview Day\".\u2026\u00a0 Since I live in Seattle, they didn't offer to put me up anywhere, but I know they will fly you out to Seattle and set you up in a Hotel as part of the process. Interview Day is essentially a series of 4-5 interviews, each lasting about 45 minutes. About 10 minutes consists of talking about what they do and asking you about yourself. The remaining time is spent answering technical algorithm questions.While I am not allowed to discuss the questions they asked in detail due to a non-disclosure agreement, my best advice would be to know your algorithms. If you're in school, I highly recommend taking a high division (400-level or equivalent) algorithms course, as it was exceedingly helpful to me. Two of the questions I was asked were questions I had been asked inside that course. Know time and space complexity, dynamic programming, and recursive programming inside and out. As long as you know your stuff (that means study), you will do great.Also, I feel like half of the interview is about culture. They are trying to test your knowledge AND determine if you fit in with the culture of Amazon. What I mean by this is:1. Be yourself. Don't suck up. This doesn't mean be rude or don't be polite to your interviewers, this just means you don't have to go with a \"Yes, sir/No, sir\" attitude.2. Don't wear a suit. They don't do that at Amazon. Wear jeans. Don't worry about shaving your beard off for the interview.3. Talk to them about what they do. They are programmers too. If you express interest, and hopefully some prior knowledge in their area of work, that will probably stick with them when decision time rolls around.So, in short, know your stuff, be yourself, and be calm. The interviewers are programmers too, they're not scary.My interview was on a Friday, and I was offered the job the following Monday.",

Then asked me to WAP to find the Nth Fib number(I was bewildered! Amazon, really?) Wrote the iterative version of the first ever program I learnt in my life. Asked me why I am not doing it recursively(was more than happy to answer.) He then asked me to find the nth prime in the least number of iterations(used the square root rule for reducing the number of comparisons). He tweaked around the same question like what would you do if want to find primes between two numbers. Complexity and all that. Given a set of billion numbers, how would you pick the biggest million numbers? When do u use hashes and how different is it from encryption? (Oh yea!). Some basic questions on patterns.OOPS question- Design a ZooSuggestions: All they look for is how you can explain things in the easiest way.

After that he asked to write a code using an online editor where he can see what I write listen to me walk him through the code. He asked to write a code to find the intersection between to lists.

I tried my best, but reminded how valuable a good IDE is. Know your algorithms and their big-o. Know how to find test cases.

I was also asked to do a\u2026\u00a0 simple coding problem too. That evening I received an email saying I passed the first round and they'd like me to come back 2 days later for 3 more interviews.The interview questions were quite challenging. I don't think I did very well at the second interview, which was writing a code that takes a float and output a string representing a price in the format $xx,xxx.xx. I managed to produce a working piece of code but with a lot of help from the interviewer so I think if you're stuck, you should ask for hints and they don't mind it.I was more successful at the third interview in which I was asked solve two problems, again the programming language was my choice.The last round was different from the previous three. I was given a problem and was asked to describe an algorithm to solve it. No coding required. In fact when I started to write down some code I was reminded that I only need to describe the algorithm.Optimization was a big deal because I was asked to analyze running time of my code and to optimize them, especially at the last round.After the last round, I was asked if I need to know their decision by any specific time. I said I'd like to know their decision before then end of the year. The interviewer smiled and said it wouldn't take that long. Typically it'd take 2-3 weeks. That's why I was so surprised and excited when I got an email from them later that day announcing I was offered the position. So basically it took less than 4 days for the entire process.",

Amazon provided all travel and expenses, including 2 nights in a hotel, $85/day in transportation and $65/day in food. Interview began at 8:15 am, with 24 candidates. Vast majority of candidates presented non-American passports as identification, and only 2 were female. Breakfast was provided,\u2026\u00a0 two current SDEs talked to the group and took questions, then we were divided into groups of 3 and presented with a supply chain problem to solve on laptops with clean Ubuntu installs. No guidance or preference for programming languages or problem solving techniques were expressed; instead, they expect your group to come to a consensus, install the necessary tools, and rock it out. It was stressed repeatedly the exercise was NOT competitive, but instead team oriented. A group was put in each corner of the room, and a table of SDEs and HR reps sat in the middle of the room and \"observed\" 6 hours of work. After several hours, each candidate got a 15-20 minute 1-on-1 with an SDE to discuss the code they'd written (and not much else). The entire process is geared to maximize success for 21-25 year old males and eliminate anyone female and/or older, and inherently makes forming a quick team difficult. It's also obvious Amazon expects that new employees are looking for stepping stones rather than a long-term career as they make no effort to get to know any of the candidates, or identify specific teams on which they may fit. Got a call 2 days after getting home letting me know they wouldn't be making an offer, which was wonderful news as I was completely clear that based on the interview process, Amazon would not be a good fit for me and would have declined an offer anyway.",

The question was: given an array of ints, find the sum of most common repeated number. For example {4,2,3,1,8,3} should return 3+3 = 6. I had to give two answers one with least time complexity and one with least space complexity. So I implemented the typical answers using a hashmap, or the naive one with O(1) space complexity and one extra using sort.I unit tested and documented all my code properly, also had time to write a performance test and document how to parallelize any of the algorithms.Its been a while since I sent them the answer but I received no response. The lady who was quick to reply to my emails also did not reply to my follow up email! It is really disrespectful, asking someone to sit for a test and totally ignoring him after that!

There was already a simple (but flawed) structure in place and I was asked to improve it based upon various upgrades they wanted to implement. If you know your OO you'll be fine, it was mostly common sense stuff.It ended up with the data structure/algorithm question which I was asked to describe in detail then code using an online collaboration tool so he could see me typing. The problem was writing an algorithm to detect when two linked lists intersect. The key I think is to keep talking and make sure you are explaining what you're thinking. He wanted me to improve the initial design and so I did and he accepted it as a good solution. We then talked a bit about Amazon, Seattle and what I'd be working on if I got the job.Overall I think it went well and as long as you're up on details on your resume, OO and data structures you should be ok.",

In short, be adept with the standard data structures and using them optimally. It involved writing almost all of the functions on a whiteboard.Heuristics were brushed upon briefly, only to lead to \"okay, now that you've done that - how would you do it faster?\".There weren't any questions about working with others, design processes, maintainability, past experience. They showed no interest in any portfolio content.They were happy to answer questions about what it's like to work there, but I detected some dishonesty about it - it was not as good as they made it sound. Individuals and teams are \"on call\" 24/7 for any bugs that are found in their code. Other sites cite Amazon for poor home/work balance. Managers didn't seem to understand their leadership role. While the newer projects and cutting edge algorithms/designs obviously excited the engineers, it seemed like there was a lot of tension. Conversely, the workplace was riddled with fun posters, decor, sticky notes, nerf guns and dogs.I feel I did relatively well in the interview - I was able to clarify their deliberately vague requests and produce a quick sample/algorithm, and then refine it to what I believed to be optimal (which came out to O(1) or O(n) in my cases).I was honest that I had not sought to work for them (they found me), that I needed to consider Seattle a bit more before moving, and that I had little experience in working on large server/database applications.

The second phone interview was also late July. Then the on-site interview was at the beginning of September. About a week after the on-site interview they contacted me with their offer.First the interview was for a position in the transaction\u2026\u00a0 risk management group (what the recruiter found me for), but then also for a position in the global fulfillment platform group. The second position was referred to me by a friend at Amazon because he knew the manager of the group. My first phone interview was with the first team, my second phone interview was with the second team, and for my on-site I talked with the first team in the morning and the second team in the afternoon. The on-site interview was spread out between two of Amazon's Seattle offices. Once everyone moves to the new South Lake Union office this thankfully shouldn't happen any more -- it's pretty annoying, especially when the interviewers don't really know the shuttle schedule that well and you miss the right shuttle!On-site interviews consisted of one engineer from each team, the manager for each team, some engineers from other teams, and one architect that was working with multiple teams. I think the architect was probably the \"bar-raiser\" but really his questions were not any more difficult than the others. He did not seem as easy to get along with though which made it more stressful.",

Asking me about my experiences in software engineering. Asked me if I am proficient with Java, then asked me if I am familiar with C++.Then asked me about Java keywords final, finalize, and finally. I couldn't remember what finalize was, and he briefly explained me then I could remember it was for garbage collection. I told him its relationship with the garbage collection, then he asked me to explain how Java does garbage collection. After my explanation (mentioning Mark&Sweep among them), he ask me if I know how Mark&Sweep is implemented. I know what it was but didn't know how it's implemented (extra bit, traversing from each \"roots\"), I just told him I do not know.Two coding questions followed.Given array of integers, how do you find the first pair that adds up to 10.I asked if the array contains negative numbers, and he said yes.Solved the problem using HashMap, then he asked me the second coding question.Given array of integers represending historic stock prices sorted in order of date (first one is the earliest price and the last is the latest price.) If you can trade only one stock, you can only buy once and sell once, and can hold the stock maximum 30 days, how would you find the buying and selling point that maximize the profit.I tried to clearify some points buy asking if each number represent closing price.I couldn't solve it, and he dumbed it down to following question.You have an array of 30 integers representing the historic stock price sorted by date.How would you find the buying and selling point that maximize the profit?I paniced that I screwed up the interview, and couldn't think of anything better than O(n^2) brute force solution.He asked me to send him the answer through email.I asked what kind of software development environment they use (RAD, eclipse, emacs, etc.),and if he enjoys working for the company.He was pretty honest about what he likes and doesn't like about the company.After the interview was over, I tried to solve the problem with better algorithm which I couldn't find.I ended up sending something stupid, tried to go to bed (which I couldn't) and sent the brute force one too.Next day, I was able to solve the problem, and sent him the solution.It's been 4 days and I'm still waiting to hear back from them.",

        "details": "I had a phone interview with Amazon. I was referred by a friend from mitbbs, and was contacted by a recruiter about one week after the referral. We set up a time for the first phone interview. The recruiter was responsive and nice, and the only weird thing was that she mentioned she would send me some application forms but she never did.I didn't quite have a real expectation to\u2026\u00a0 get an offer from Amazon. For the first phone interview, I was surprised that the interviewer called 3hours earlier than I expected, but it turned out to be my mistake :( I didn't pat attention to the time zone. Even though I was caught by a surprise, the first phone interview was just a piece of a cake for me, the coding problem was simply deleting some numbers in an array. After that there was an even simpler classic problem: in an array, all numbers appear twice except one special number, how to find that number. I told the interviewer with honesty that I knew the problem and he moved on to the next. The next and also last problem was asking, if you have two eggs, N floors, how to find the critical floor number below which all eggs dropped will not break, and above which all eggs dropped will break.By the way, their interviewers are really really nice.I was informed about passing the first interview only two days later. I had the second interview about two weeks later during travel. I was not fully prepared but I was much less nervous than the first time, as I was getting very close to my dream offer from another company. The interviewer called, and started with asking me why I want to be a software engineer. Then he asked me about some knowledge and concepts of hashing, which I was quite familiar with. After that was the coding question, which was sent to me as an email. After reading the problem and explaining my approach to the interviewer, he decided not to have me write the code! I still couldn't figure out why, since clearly the title of the email said \"coding question\". Maybe I left him an impression that my coding skills were so strong that he didn't even need to see it? But I never demonstrated any of my coding skills to him. The last problem was OOD, as expected from Amazon's interview. I was relatively weak in this area, but I managed to grab some key words and key ideas which made him somewhat content.I was notified about the result a couple of days later, and I was told by the recruiter that I did very well in my phone interviews, although I personally doubt it...",

The entire interview took an hour.While I get that amazon.com deals with large quantities of data and efficient evaluation of that data is necessary, I think they may be eliminating very good candidates with excellent capacity to learn (like myself, of course) by asking for answers to questions that the CODE IS ALREADY WRITTEN FOR.

I had three phone interviews with the Customer Returns area and the Ops area.The first interview was with a younger, male developer. It had a \"get to know you\" section and two technical questions: Find the first common element in two sets (implement the code), and design the objects needed to run a jukebox.The second interview was\u2026\u00a0 with a senior male developer. It also had a \"get to know you\" section and two technical questions: Given a time-ordered log of user visits to web pages find the most common 3-page sequence (implement the code), and design a poker application.The third interview was with a foreign, younger female developer. She jumped right into the technical questions which were: Find the deepest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree structure (implement the code), and layout the fundamental objects to build a restaurant reservation system. This was probably the worst interview of the lot because it felt like the interviewer didn't understand the language (C++) she had asked me to write in even though I could easily have done it in several others.The biggest takeaways here were that the questions were all canned and could be looked up, the coding would have better been managed by text instead of over the phone, and there was very little feedback on how my answers were. In general, there were gaps of more than a week in which I heard nothing at all and given no insight as to why, the interviewers seemed to take notes but only the last one seemed to have read them.Overall, the whole thing was just a long, drawn-out mess, and a waste of a month. I'm lucky enough to be currently employed or I would be irate about how slow the process was. When I interviewed with several other companies (including Microsoft) a couple years ago the longest it took was a week including on-site interviews.

This happened the following\u2026\u00a0 week. Format was very similar to the first one - All technical questions and a few questions about my experience.Two days after the 2nd phone screen, received an email stating they'd like to fly me up for an on-site interview. Fly up to Seattle day before the interview, and got to look around the town.The actual on site interview process consisted of 5 developer interviews that were about 45 minutes each. These interviews were heavily white-board based and involved high level design questions, low level coding questions, and debugging / support process questions. Interviewers all seemed very relaxed and informal. They did not seem so much about trying to find gaps in your knowledge / wrong answers as they were about pushing you towards the limits of what you knew and then seeing how you dealt with questions that you did not immediately know the answer to.One of the 5 developer interviews was the bar-raiser, who's purpose at Amazon is ensuring that you're smart and a good fit for Amazon as a company. Many of the questions in this interview were more high level asking about design patterns, and language specifications. While the interview definitely was more difficult than the others, it did not feel overly aggressive or negative.In addition to the developer interviews, there was lunch with the hiring manager and a 15 minute interview with the recruiter. The lunch was an opportunity to ask more about Amazon and the team.

Shortly after that, they contacted me to schedule an initial technical interview with a software development manager. The first interview was difficult, but I apparently answered the questions well enough to be invited back for three more technical interviews with Amazon software engineers. I went through a total of four in-person\u2026\u00a0 1-on-1 technical interviews, each lasting approximately 45 minutes. After I completed those interviews, a recruiter notified me within a few days to notify me that Amazon would be offering me a job, and a different recruiter contacted me a couple of days after that to give me the specifics of the offer.My advice: the interview questions will be difficult, but be confident, explain your thought process well, and retain your composure even if you think the interview is going badly. You might be doing better than the interviewer is letting on.",

At one point I was asked \"design a system that X\", with no other prompting. I was quite unprepared for something this vague, and I struggled with exactly what I should do to \"design\" the system in that moment, even if the design of such a system was not very difficult. I would highly recommend preparing for a question such as this.Furthermore, they will ask you for stories about your career. A lot of them. I found myself struggling to remember enough unique situations where I'd encountered and solved the issues that they asked about. I prepared for this by coming up with stories, but I underestimated just how many of such questions they'd ask.

        "details": "I usually don't write reviews but since I used glass door a lot, I wanted to give back some. So I interviewed for an Australian position. I first went through 2 phone screens which included coding and behaviour and technical behavioural questions (eg. what is clean code?). The emphasis was on getting the coding correct and less on the behavioural stuff but be prepared for those type of questions like:\u2026\u00a0 when was a challenging time you had at work, how do you deal with tight deadlines etc... The second phone interview coding question is a bit harder than the first phone interview.I then got scheduled in for an on-site interview at the Australian office but predominantly it was done through VC link to Seattle HQ. Due to the time zone difference, initially my interview would start at 8am, 5 interviews then lunch break then final interview. A total of 6 interviews, 5 of them are 45mins, 1 of them only 30 mins. This interview was setup 3 weeks in advance but 36 hours before the interview, I get an email from Amazon HR that the schedule has changed and that it will be 6 interviews in a row. So do the maths, that's 4 hours and 15 mins STRAIGHT. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out 6 interviews in a row is going to mentally drain you...to death. I was set up. They knew this was going to happen as the change was due to an Australian manager being in the US. I'm sure they knew this well in advance. Even other Australians didn't get this treatment. This severely tested my mental endurance.Ok - I had a bathroom break in the middle and got some water but that was it. I was doing really well until the last 10 minutes of the 4th interview where I couldn't fix a bug in my program. I was brain dead and stressed. Overall the people I interviewed with were nice, but some came across as unbelievably arrogant.To you young ones out there, I am 30 years old and have worked for 8 years as a professional software engineer at major companies. These are very much red flags of how the company treats people, at a system level and also at a personal level. I've been around long enough to see and smell poison when it comes. Nice on the surface, but fundamentally don't care about you. Just do some research on Amazon's poor attrition rates and work culture. Money only means so much. Do some research in how many job advertisements there are for Amazon SDEs over the last 3-4 years, there's a zillion. You're going to be a cog in a machine. The Amazon formal PROCESSED hiring bar is quite high but it is selectively applied to certain positions. But not everyone gets in this way. I personally know people who got in by references at Amazon, Google and Facebook. My point here is that they're all still human, just like you and me. Don't let the high bar intimidate you.I'm writing this review not necessarily to get you in but to help you see companies for what they are. If you want in - ok great, but your choice. If it's your first tech job, then go for it.MOST IMPORTANTLY, ask yourself this question: do really want to work for eCommerce websites/<insert job here> or are you interested in Amazon because of their brand name/high salary? Do you know Amazon has both boring and interesting tech jobs? How important is this to you? How does this affect your future career path? What is your purpose in life? Is it related to your career? Consider work-life balance etc...Long story, I couldn't start in the time they wanted me (I was at least 4/5 months delayed) to so they didn't offer me at the time and said will coordinate further down the track. Did I get rejected? Probably. In the mean time, I got a very good job offer with very very interesting work form another reputable company. After Amazon's interview, the hardest I've ever done, this other company's was relatively easier. Even if you don't succeed, the interview process will train you for the future but learn from your mistakes. Trust God and have confidence in yourself.God bless",

        "details": "I applied on the web responding to an offer and providing a resume. I was contacted the day after (really) and asked to have an online programming test. I had 7 days to do it but I did it right after receiving the email. The test was of 2 hours and consisted in three problems, two of them were pretty easy and I found the last one much harder. The\u2026\u00a0 email explained that the code will be reviewed manually by Amazon engineers.Less than a week later, I was invited to set a date for a phone interview. We set it for two weeks later. The interview was 90% technical and included basic data structure knowledge and complexity. There also had a conception question and a problem solving. Nothing too complicated for a serious candidate.They mailed me back a week later (a Friday) to invite me to join an Assesment Day the next Thursday. I went to it, it consisted in a day starting with a short introduction to the different teams and the challenge they had to face. We were 8 to this assesment day, 4 such days were organized and we were told they had 6 vacancies. After the presentation, I had 4 face-to-face interviews each of 45 min - 1h, with a nice sandwich pause between the second and the third interview. Almost all interviews included question based on the experience (\"Tell me a time when ...\"). They dig into your example quite far, so come up with real and interesting examples. The second interview only consisted in a programming session which I found very easy compared to the other technical questions. Of course, all interviews were mainly technical.The first one was about generalities and were pretty easy. I found the third and the fourth much more difficult. The third one included a long conception question and a problem solving question. Finally, the last one was only a problem solving question (a problem that the team had actually had to handle, probably simplified) that we discussed very deeply. These are the only interviews where I was not able to provide what I thought to be the best answer, since I came up with better ideas soon after the interviewers left the room. For problem solving question, especially the last one, they don't seem to be interested in seeing you solve that all, but rather detect all the difficulties and propose a na\u00efve solution (but being aware of that and explaining what should be improved and how, if you have any idea).",

        "details": "OK, I think everybody knows an average process of Amazon's interview. So I want to write something that I didn't find usually in reviews..HOW TO PREPARE* rest well before interview. Be in a good mood. Smile! Smile all the time!* read book \"Cracking coding interview\". I didn't have any single question from there, but this book has 2 huge pros - it helps you to understand how your interview will\u2026\u00a0 look like and how to prepare to it (yes, this first, smallest part of book helped me A LOT! I never had such interviews before), and it could help you remember basic stuffs about algorithms etc (especially if you graduated more than 5 years ago).* they will send you a list of questions to prepare. Pass whole list, use Wikipedia at least, jump between links, etc. - it will also help you* prepare your own questions for them. Be personal! Ask exactly what you want to know! Maybe, you will not have another chance to ask such questions* sleep well for at least one week before* don't drink alcohol for at least 3 days before* eat well before. Approx. - in 1-1.5 hours before. Eat something that you like, and something that is good for sure ;)* be there in 15-30 minutes before scheduled timeON INTERVIEW* talk out loud! Talk out all the time! Talk out all stupid stuffs that you have in your mind! Most probably, they don't care how much you know, they should care - how much you can \"invent\"! So, if you don't know some famous algorithm, but you can \"invent\" it just on interview (of course, with mistakes) - it's much, much better!!!* be honest. Don't try to cheat. If you know exact answer to exact question - talk out loud first - \"I know an answer. I just read about it yesterday\". And then, if your interviewer will say you \"go on\" - answer on it. First of all - they will know that you're honest person, and they can trust you. Again - it doesn't matter in general - how much you know, it matters more - how much you can invent! Because in Amazon you will solve problems that probably nobody solve before..* amazing quote from book \"Cracking coding interview\": \"Despite the questions onpolymorphism and heaps and virtual machines, the question interviewers really want an answer to is : Would I have a beer with this guy?\"... So - smile! Be honest! Be yourself!* \"your future teammates (most probably, your interviewer is one of them) want to be sure that they can rely on you. That you can work yourself\" - another quote from the same book. So - prove them that you can work yourself!* don't answer immediately, think a little before. But think aloud! Be sure that your interviewer knows that you're thinking and not answering ;)* if you find a mistake in your answer (even in question that you answered 10 minutes ago) - don't be afraid to fix it* if you have ANY question - ask it! It could change your answer really a lot.. (one guy answered to 10 my specifying questions - \"I don't know\".. And it was actually right answers ;) but usually you will receive a lot of information)* yeah, I messed all the time. I did errros. I did one HUGE error, most stupid error in my last few years. But - I talked out loud! I talked all the time, I talked about what I think about it etc. So, again - talk out loud! This is your mantra for interview* if you see how you can optimize your solution - optimize it! Optimize it all the time. And talk out loud why you think it's better! Don't be afraid to change you code. But be sure that you will finish your task in time!* stand out from the \"crowd\". Be different. Of course, probably you should not paint you hair in blue color ;) but be sure that you are not like \"everyone\". You should be \"a little different\". They should remember you* ask about requirements for code. They could be different - maybe, much more loose than you think (e.g., when I said that my solution will be non-optimal, one guy said that he need ..A.. solution. My solution was horrible, but I \"delivered\" it. Just in last seconds of our interview. He looked very happy...)AFTER INTERVIEWHave a beer! You deserve it.",

        "details": "A recruiter contacted me through LinkedIn and informed me about a recruiting event for Amazon's eCommerce Platforms Division taking place in my area in a month. I was surprised that Amazon would fly interviewing teams to different cities for recruitment (the usual process is for them to invite candidates to Seatlle). I expressed interest and the recruiter asked me to go through a phone screen as early as possible because\u2026\u00a0 the interview slots were filling up. The interview team was going to be in my city only for two days.I setup the phone interview for the same day. The phone screen as quick and the interviewer asked me a somewhat difficult question that I did not expect interviewers to ask during a phone interview. He indicated that I need not code and that he wanted to just hear how I would solve the problem. Fortunately for me, the insight on how to solve came pretty quickly and the interviewer seemed happy.After three days, I contacted the interviewer about my phone interview and he gave the good news that I had cleared it and that I would take part in the recruiting event in my city. He said he would contact me about exact date and time in the next few days which he did.The interview took place in a building in a famous area that Amazon must have leased for the event. My interview loop consisted of a 15 minute intro by the recruiter (different from the one who contacted me through LinkedIn) followed by three 45 minute technical interview and one 45 minute hiring manager interview. I thought I screwed up the first one and did well on the other two technical interviews. The last one was not a technical, the questions were more about how I would handle stress, what to expect at Amazon etc.,The recruiter said that Amazon typically moves very quickly if they like a candidate and asked me to expect an email the same day (Friday) or by Sunday latest. The email finally arrived on Sunday with good news after an agonizing wait.",
        "questions": [
            "I am not going to reveal the questions here. I had heard about the question that the first interviewer asked. It is an open-ended question. The interviewer qucikly became frustrated with the direction I was going and had to rein me in a little bit. I was frustrated about why then he asked such an open ended question. Anyway, his intentions were clear when he asked the follow-up which I\u2026\u00a0 found to be an interesting one. But unfortunately time was running out at that point and I quickly suggested some ways I would solve the problem. In hindsight, I realized this was an important question because Amazon had designed a product around it and uses it very heavily internally.The second interview was about the application of efficient data structures to solve a problem. I quickly arrived at the solution and coded it. There was more time left in the interview and we talked about problems arising in a distributed architecture setup.The third interviewer was nice and asked if I needed a restroom break. I gladly took his offer. This interview was also about the application of an efficient data structure. I initially proposed a multi-threaded solution to his problem. He asked a few follow-ups which I was able to answer. But he eventually asked me to give a single-threaded solution which required the realization of a need for an efficient data structure. I quickly realized that I needed a data structure to solve a problem, but he had to give me some hints to arrive at the right one which ironically was what I had proposed for the question asked by the second interviewer.The last interview was not very technical. The interviewer asked about what I did my current role, how I would handle stress, what to expect at Amazon etc., After the interview was over, he walked me out of the building and wished me good luck. \u00a0"

The discussion goes on inorder to improve the efficiency of algorithm. Then he stops us at a point and asks us to write code in callaboration tool. he will looking at the code we are writing. They dont care about small syntax errors. After couple of days I contacted the recruiter and she said that I was not picked up for an interview. I can understand the reason, I am not that good at algorithms and data structures. So my advice would be going through all the algorithms and datastructures before you apply online. Also I would suggest to work on as many problems as yo u can, so that you can get know multiple ways of solving a problem.",

The interviews themselves were alright, but the process was not pleasant. After the initial inquiry, HR sent me an email to request for the first interview. I replied and waited 2 weeks for the HR to schedule me the interview time. I did fine in the first interview. After another week, HR sent me a request for the second interview and it took another week for her to schedule it. So 1.5 months already passed since I applied. I did alright in the second interview. And the same process for the HR, waited 2 weeks for her to schedule me the 3rd interview, which she scheduled on Black Friday. I sent her an email to confirm the unusual time, but she did not reply. As expected, the interviewer was a no call. A few days later, HR apologized saying the interviewer had an emergency. Anyways, 3rd interview was rescheduled, but I did not do well.

I was asked to code on paper while explaining my thought process on the phone, which I always find hard to do, but I thought I did okay. I didn't have any problems with the coding itself.I was contacted for a second round of interview a week later, and scheduled the interview 2 weeks after the call. It was another technical phone interview with Java concepts and programming problems. Unfortunately, the interviewer had a thick accent and the phone connection wasn't very clear (I heard a lot of background noises from his end) so I found it hard to understand him. He asked me about how to design the system at Amazon for displaying the availability of an item; this one I couldn't answer (more detail about the question below).

This interview can be difficult or easy depending on what kind of projects you've done, what kind of activities you engage in. Typically, this round assesses your overall qualities, and assesses if you're fit to work for Amazon.com. Was a really long interview, about 2 and half hours.Third interview was again on algorithms and data structures. I was asked an odd question regarding race condition, and synchronized blocks in java. I was given no hints in this round, although I eventually managed to answer all the questions he asked. Duration: 1hour 15mins.Foruth interview was with a senior developer at Amazon.com. He asked four questions, and told me to write my best code for each, with utmost optimization. He told me I can take all the time in the world to solve the problems. Each one was algorithm based. After I had answered all the four, I walked him through all the test cases.
