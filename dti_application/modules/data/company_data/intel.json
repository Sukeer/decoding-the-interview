First, I was contacted for a phone screening that was pretty straightforward with a few behavioral questions and technical questions that felt like they were read off of a paper. After passing the phone screening I was contacted two days later with a second\u2026\u00a0 more technical phone screening. It also had a few behavioral questions and a few questions that actually asked me how I would design a program.A couple days after that, I was contacted for a flight out to the Intel campus for an in person interview. The flight scheduling was really nice, Intel covered everything (flight, hotel, car rental, food).The on campus interview was rather intense, not because it was hard but because it was draining. It started at 8:00 AM and I had interviews with 9 people (mostly 1 hour, but two were half hour) ending at 5:00 PM.The on campus interviews tended to always start with a behavioral question or two, then they would lead off into technical questions. I was asked to write code on a whiteboard, locate bugs in some printed code, write code on paper, and how I would design certain solutions (sometimes with code and sometimes with just a high level overview).The Intel campus was great! It was HUGE compared to what I'm used to. The campus had three food courts (which had some good food from the lunch that was provided for me), a spa and salon, massage therapist, gym (with karate and yoga classes at the moment, but I was told more are offered), play area (ping pong tables, pool tables, air hockey tables, and what's even better is people were actually playing!), US Bank branch (not just an ATM, but actually a desk with a teller), and health center with a doctor and nurses (you know, for all the injuries programmers get from typing. Actually, you can go there for all your regular checkups).",

Asked me questions regarding my CV.... asked about few projects that I had on my CV... then some behavioral questions...but no technical questions... Then informed me that I will have 1 or 2 technical interviews..... The only problem I had with the procedure was that one of the interviewer\u2026\u00a0 send me an email without explicitly telling me that it is the same position I already had my pre-technical interview and asked me for sometime on the same day.... I took it as a pre-technical interview of another position... (as I applied for multiple Intern positions so I wasnt sure).... My mistake was to accept the interview request.... I wasnt ready for it at that time.. and I was not properly informed.",

        "details": "I applied online and about 3 weeks later received an email requesting a phone interview. The phone interview was basically the manager talking about the position and asking some questions about my background and a few technical questions; this phone interview lasted about 30 minutes. I was immediately invited to do two technical phone interviews with team members, which I did the next day. The first technical phone interview was\u2026\u00a0 only about 25 minutes, and I was asked mostly general (although fairly difficult) C++ questions. The second technical phone interview was about 1 hour and was almost entirely architecture questions, several of which went quite in depth. About 2 hours later I was invited for an on-site interview.About 2 weeks later I went to Santa Clara for the on-site interview. They flew me down on a Sunday, the interview was on Monday, and I left on Tuesday. The interview was about 5 hours. My first 1:1 interview was an hour long with a team member, and he mostly asked about various C++ and OOP topics. The second 1:1 interview was also an hour and mostly involved me writing code (C and assembly) on paper to solve a few problems. Next I had a half hour interview with the manager, who asked a few technical questions, but mostly told me about the benefits. Then was a 1:30 hour lunch with the team. After that I had a one hour discussion with a team member, which was fairly casual conversation about the position and team and area (no hard or technical questions). Finally I had another half hour interview with the manager and he mostly told me about what they were looking for and I tried to sell myself.I was told t hey would let me know within one week. A week later I got a phone interview from HR offering me the position.",

On the next day, i got a call from the recruiter about my interview experience and told\u2026\u00a0 me he would get back to me in a day or two. That was the last time that recruiter had called me and I am still waiting for his call (to get back to me). As per Intel's policy, they boast that no matter what the interview result is, they would get back to the interviewee but I haven't heard back from them till date and so I have anticipated that I am not selected. I tried calling the recruiter couple of times but either he was on other call or busy as he used to hang up my phone without answering. The least I expected was a call back from him but still he haven't got back to me.",

The assignment should only take a couple hours at most.In person:finally, a couple weeks later I was flown out to the company where i had 4 1 hour interviews, with a lunch break half way through. The interviews each had a specific theme, software, hardware, testing and design, and behavioral. None of the tests were particularly challenging, but as always, they are much harder on the spot. Most of the tester's made an effort to not react to any of the answers given during the interview, so it's hard to tell how successful you were until its over.The facilities were very nice, aside from workstations being small cubicles. During lunch while talking with the managers, i got the sense that there was a genuinely good work culture at the company, and that Intel was a very family friendly company, despite some of the criticism I had heard about on other websites.",
