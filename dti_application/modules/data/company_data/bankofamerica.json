        "details": "I was contacted by a recruiter after applying through my school's job posting website. The recruiter sent an automated message indicating that I must apply directly to the website.One day later an e-mail came into my inbox for one job that explained that a phone interview would be conducted within two weeks. The description included a 30 minute interview with another recruiter and was behavioral based. The information requested was\u2026\u00a0 the graduation date, visa sponsorship requirement, and location.A rejection letter followed two and a half weeks later, about one week after the interview.During this time period of the interview for the first position, I was brought in for an on campus interview (at my school) and was asked behavioral, technical, past experience, and hypothetical questions and then again asked for my location preferences. Another phone interview was conducted for a different position.One week after the rejection I received an e-mail requesting an on-site interview. (I mention the rejection because both happened parallel, it may be that I was rejected for the first to participate in this one, it wasn't made clear and these interviews happened a few days apart).The on site interview was 5 days after the e-mail.The on site interview consisted of 2 daysDay 1: Settle in at an expensive paid hotel and mingled with current employees at a restaurant with drinks and food. Listened to a speech by a manager and spoke to people from many departments. A folder was given to us that explained the schedule for the next couple of days and the people we would interact with.Day 2: Escorted to another hotel in a convention room with about 9 curtained booths that hid interviewers from the company. Breakfast was served for an hour or two and interviews began. I was interviewed by 3 people, one an obvious hardcore banker, one very experienced banker with a more relaxed attitude, and one who was a technical person with a CS degree. The other half of the participants performed a group interview , which was the second portion. Teams were assembled randomly and seated at round tables with materials in the middle. In the middle, there was masking tape, paper clips, rubber bands, news papers, and pipe cleaners. The objective was to make a bridge that sustained an unknown weight. First 5-10 minutes were the planning phase, 10 more minutes were used to construct, 10 more minutes were constructing without speech. The test was to see how our interaction was and our method of communication under pressure with given materials.After the interviews we spoke to the employees once more and left for our flight.",
