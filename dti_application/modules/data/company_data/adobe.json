        "details": "I got my interview through a resume drop at my university's CS career fair (for reference, my university is a top 20 CS school, top 50 overall).First part of the process was a phone screen, and was also where my apprehension began with the position I was interviewing for. The screen was about 25 minutes, majority behavioral (what would you do in this situation, past projects, etc.). The closest thing\u2026\u00a0 I had gotten to a technical question was an open-ended question about writing a function that returns 1 given 0 and 0 given 1 (multiple solutions). I figured they gave me a snowball because the interviewer had decided to pass on me, but lo and behold I got an email the next day for an onsite (*excited*).They flew me out to San Jose and put me up in a nice hotel. Interview process was like others have described on here: first day is a career fair/team matching event, second day is interviews. I got matched with two teams.Both interviews were with a panel of senior engineers on each of the respective teams. The first interview had a handful of technical questions, some easy and some a little tougher but no DP or intricate problems; I thought I did above average. The second interview was entirely abstract, talking about my experience on past projects, thoughts on X or Y programming language, favorite university course/data structure/hobby. Not a single technical questions, which I thought was odd for a final round.I got an offer from both teams I interviewed with, but ended up declining. From what I understand, both teams did their evaluations of me independently. The fact that team 2 had given me an offer without me having demonstrated any actual ability to code (between the phone screen and my interview with them) was a red flag for me. I use on-site interviews as a means to judge the caliber of the company I am interviewing for. While I found my interviewers very personable, the technical aspect of these interviews failed to make me feel as if I had \"earned\" the position, and overall gave me a negative perception of engineering culture at Adobe.Adobe is a cool company doing interesting work, but in the end I decided to pursue other options.",

The next day you only interview with the teams that chose you.They base their hiring decision off this one 50 minute interview session, and there were no openings that was relevant to my initial interest ranking to begin with.On top of that, they told us at the end of the onsite round that they were going to get back to us with a phone call \"at the end of the following week at the latest\".
