Second question was a design question, no code.Onsite was an onsite-day so there were many applicants interviewing at the\u2026\u00a0 same time (you still interview by yourself though). Four rounds in total. First two are 2:1 with engineers and very technical. You write code on pads of ~6x8 paper (wouldn't have been my medium of choice). 3rd round is a 1:1 with a senior engineer/engineer manager(?); no coding. 4th round is with HR.Interviewers were very friendly and willing to nudge you if it looked like you were getting stuck. They all seemed very intelligent which was a bit intimidating. The questions were also interesting and fun. First round was more algorithms and second round more data structures but that may have just been a coincidence.",

He asked a pretty standard interview question, and I coded it up online where he could see (I think it was on a HackerRank page). I thought they prefered C++, but he asked me if I wanted\u2026\u00a0 to do it in Java and I said yes because I'm more comfortable with that. I don't actually think that hurt my chances in any way. That question went fine, and then he asked me a few follow ups about scalability and bugs to check for. Then he went into some very specific C++ questions, which I stumbled through since I had only taken a semester of C++. Somehow I passed that interview and made it to the in-house. About a week later, my recruiter asked me which of 3 days I preferred to come to NYC and interview. A few days later they made travel arrangements. During the in-house interview, they give you a little tour of the office first then you meet with your interviewers and go to a conference room. Again, questions were very standard. You have to do them on a sheet of paper. The first interview there were 2 engineers, and they asked me 3 technical questions. I blanked out especially on the first question even though it was pretty easy. The second interview was just one person, and he asked me a fairly easy question, which I got right away and he said that was all he had for me so we talked for a bit before he let me out. Interviews themselves took about 2 hours total (but there's a small break in between). A week later, I got rejected--not unexpected considering I didn't do well on the first interview.",

[start at the end and find and print words one-by-one].3- You are given a 3L and a 5L container and unlimited supply of water. How to make 1L?[I found a longer solution but the short on is pour 3L into 5 twice.]4- A program/algorithm which given mL and nL buckets figures out how (if possible) make kL. [we discussed the solution and the interviewer was nice and gave me a hint. Its a DP problem].The next day, I received and invitation for on-site interview. The travel schedule part was straightforward and convenient.I was invited to the NY office. There was a group of around 30 people like me. They hold you for a few minuts to issue a security badge. Then there is a tour about all the 31 or so aquariums and fishes at bloomberg. Eventually, there is breakfast and then the interviews come find you. There is 4 rounds of interview. Rounds 1-2 are technical, 3 is management, and 4 is HR.Some questions I remember:1- Find shortest path on a chessboard from low left corner to top right. You can move right and top only and some cells are inaccessible (DFS).2- You have sorted arrays A and B with sizes m and n. Assume at the end of array \"A\" you have \"n\" empty slots. How to merge with minimum number of operations (start at the end instead of beginning). Prove it works (induction).3- Some runners running in a field with some \"k\" sensors. We get events of runnings locations. How to print the top \"m\" runners? (array of lists or hash table of lists depending on the location of the sensors. each list is one sensor). Some questions on how to identify the ordering within each list.4- CPU Cache implementation. How to implement the least frequently used procedure.5- Scheduling some jobs over \"m\" servers.

        "details": "The phone interview was mundane and consisted of typical Data Structures and tell me about your projects type of questions, one good question was to when does the compiler necessarily not make a function marked inline as inline. I was also asked a puzzle.Was invited for the onsite interview, had my interviewed scheduled at 12:00 pm. Started the interview at around 12:05 pm, the first few questions where the general\u2026\u00a0 tell me about yourself and your projects. Then asked me about multithreading and problems associated with it, then asked about when deadlocks would occur. Difference between Semaphores and Mutex, by this time there where two interviewers, one shadow, one fairly senior, enter third interviewer at 12:13-12:15 pm, again, tell me about yourself etc.. The new interviewer asked me how to find the square root of a number without using the square root function, I knew the solution, he however asked me return the closest integer, so I was trying to figure that out, wrote a little code and he suddenly tells that's okay and asks me to write a test utility function for the sqrt function, i.e given a number and a possible guess please return if its actually the sqrt of the number, fair enough, it would just be a simple if else statement once we have used our sqrt function previously written. He had this you-are-wrong kind of face on, I was really worried and got all tensed. In hindsight, I guess he just expected me not to use the sqrt function and return true/false using just the utility function, I feel slightly flustered now, mainly because he could have just asked me that, it was neither a trick question nor a question that required a lot of thought. Anyways, now the senior interviewer asks me how to find if two lists intersect, I explained it to him (the answer is in CareerCup I guess), asked him if I should write the code, he told that wouldn't be needed. Then the other interviewer asks me about String compression, and a simpler version actually, as in aaabbbaacc would be a3b3a2c2, that was simple, told him how I could do it, in the hindsight I feel I should have given a in-place solution ( not a big deal, just required him to ask me a couple of questions on it or clarify if there is an better space efficient code is possible), again, asked him if I should write the code, he says no. The time is 12:52 PM, the guy who came in late wrapped the interview telling its almost time up, I said we could go back to the sqrt function and figure out if the solution I gave would work with a little tweaks (it would work). Then they ask me if I have any questions for them, etc etc. 12:56 PM they wrap up the interview, and they ask me to wait in the room, 15 mins later the recruiter comes in and tells me that they wouldn't continue with the interview. I felt shattered, I did not expect it at all, I did answer their questions. What was depressing was that they judged my performance on a single round of interview, I would have been okay if I actually performed bad, but my performance definitely warranted at-least may be another round to judge me, it was surely not soo off-mark that I had to be sent off immediately. Definitely this was one of the worst interviews I've faced, mainly because their perception of you is that you are a bad candidate and the interview is focused on assuring themselves that you are indeed bad rather than trying to get the best of you assuming you are actually good. Another evident problem I could see was that they just don't care, why?, because the interviews are basically general, once you've finished your training you need to again find a team that is wiling to accept you, since the interviews are general and they know that you may or may not be a part of their team, they don't care losing you. The i-don't-care attitude was so evident when I saw the guy came in late + he yawned in between the interview.The post probably makes you feel that I may be sore loser trying to vent my opinions here, I can assure you I am not, I've gotten over the interview and just wanted to give you guys a big heads-up for your interviews.",

Another one was on data structures and you should absolutely know which data structure is to be used in what situation along with the complexities for each of the operations. If you don't, then you have slim chances of answering such questions. My last question was the hardest one and required databases and multithreading combined together to form the solution. The interviewer had sort of mugged that question and had come for the interview. When I asked her to explain a little bit more, she kept on saying the same things again and again. Finally, the other interviewer had to intercept, reinterpret that question, confirm his understanding with the other interviewer and then had to explain it again to me.Overall, it was a very bad experience. The culture is not very good and you can actually sense it from the interviewers' attitude. One of my interviewers was all the time texting on his cellphone when I was given a chance to ask them questions. That was pretty rude.Warning - Check out the culture from someone inside that you know before you join!",

        "details": "The process started with visiting the Bloomberg LP booth at my university. I gave them my resume and we discussed a project or two. I then asked if they were doing interviews on campus and they told me yes. Before I could get a campus interview, I had to answer a few questions at the booth. These questions were brain teasers and C++ specific language questions. Upon impressing the recruiters\u2026\u00a0 at the booth, I was offered the on-campus interview.Next, I met with two campus recruiters about a week or two later when they were in town. It was a technical interview with a few HR undertones to see if I had done my research. Questions were mostly based on system architecture: \"how would you design a stock tracking system...?\" and data structures: \"how would you implement a queue using only the stack data structure?\"A couple weeks later, I heard from an HR representative who invited me to an on-site interview. They flew me to New York and I stayed in a hotel the night before the interview. I got to Bloomberg Tower at 10:30 am and the interview was at 11:00 am. You will be asked to check in at the front desk 15 minutes before your interview. You will have your picture taken and they will print a visitors badge for you. Then you will go up to the sixth floor and wait for your host to come greet you. My host came for me a couple minutes later and took me to a conference room on the 23rd floor of the building. The view was phenomenal. I had a fantastic view of Manhattan and Central Park.The first interview was 2-on-1. One of the interviewers was a project lead and the other was more fresh. They started with the some questions about me and my resume. I got to tell them about my favorite project and show some enthusiasm for my work. Next they asked some technical questions. Specifically the questions were algorithms and data structures questions.The next interview was 1-on-1 with someone more senior. From what I gathered he was a team lead - mobile development if I recall correctly. His questions were very direct and he made it clear that he was not trying to trip me up or ask me trick questions. He was very blunt but it was one of the best interviews I have had because the pressure was on and I had to think on my toes. His questions were of an HR nature mostly. The toughest and most surprising question he asked was \"There are many large companies with many of the same things to offer as Bloomberg LP in the city, eg Google. If a friend was there and mentioned they had opportunities available, would you pursue an opportunity there?\" See the answer below. After the HR questions, the interviewer asked me a number of coding questions ie find the bug in this code.The last interview was strictly HR stuff - including the dreaded \"do you have any expectations with respect to compensation?\" I used some of my knowledge from this website to answer with a range and tell her that I expect at least the average salary to be competitive. The HR interviewer said they routinely offer higher than the number I requested.At the end of every interview I was given the opportunity to ask questions.I heard from HR in only 3 business days with an offer.",

They had recruiters heading to our school so I was set up with an interview upon their arrival in early march.There were three interviewers present that day, one main guy and two others. I was interviewed by one of the secondary guys, but halfway through the main guy came in and took over the interview. The interview was all technical. First guy asked about matrix coding in\u2026\u00a0 my preferred language (java) and then asked me to do more with it and then improve upon the code. Then he asked about running times of the two pieces of code. The other (main) guy, wrote a sample code in C and asked me to explain it and then answer questions relating to it. I had no experience in C, which I had already told him, to which he replied \"excellent\". Interview lasted ~1 hour.I heard nothing from them until 3 weeks later (though I attribute this delay to the fact that they returned to NYC and then my area had a big snow storm). I received a call about a second interview. At the second interview the same 'main' guy from before interviewed me . Another technical interview asking me to write a piece of code that had a finance twist, in my language of choice. At the end I was immediately asked to return the next day for the third interview. Lasted ~1 hour.The third interview was actually two separate interviews, first with a senior member, and then with a HR personnel. These were not technical interviews. The senior member presented me with a real world problem and asked what steps I would go about in trying to solve it. The HR personnel was mainly there, in my opinion, to observe interviewees' personalities. Both interviews combined lasted ~40min.I then did not receive word for another two weeks, at which point I was informed (phone/email) that I had been accepted but there were no training positions open.

I did but I did not give all the functions he expected. He asked me the famous reversing linked lists question but I did not know then that its a popular C++ interview question. I was so nervous that I messed up even the general \"what sets you apart\", \"Why this job\" type of questions. As expected, I was not selected for the next round.My advice: If you are applying for a s/w developer position, even though the requirements do not state you need to be an expert coder, take it for granted that you must be.

The phone interview really goes the direction that you take. I think they just want to see your thought process and how you work out problems. I didn't get everything right and I admitted when I didn't know something. Even though the interview was supposed to be 45 min, it lasted over an hour.

I then got a call that evening to go in the next morning for an interview.I was then interviewed by two people for a technical interview- about 3 or 4 logic and programming questions. (Either pseudocode or actual syntax from a language of your\u2026\u00a0 choice is usually fine.) Only took about 20 minutes. They asked me to leave the room, and after a minute of deliberation, an interviewer asked me if I could go back in the afternoon for another interview.I came back to another technical interview with two different interviewers. After another couple minutes of deliberation among the recruiters, I was asked to do a \"senior interview\" right then. They asked a few simple behavioral questions (nothing tricky) and one logic question. Seemed more like a conversation than an interview. Again, it was short, nothing more than 30 mins.That was it. Seven days later I got a call and a job offer!All the people who interviewed me seemed to be laid back and very friendly. They let me ask any questions I had and gave honest answers from their own experiences. (They are not allowed to go into specifics about compensation packages, however, i.e. typical salaries, relocation packages, bonuses, etc... but just know that it will be very generous.) The friendly atmosphere really helped put me at ease, which helped out overall. I realized that these guys weren't trying to grill me, they just wanted to get a feel for who I was and whether or not I would fit their culture.Some tips for people interested in interviewing:- They don't expect you to be a perfect programmer, though some computer science coursework will definitely help your resume get noticed. They are really looking for students from all technical backgrounds who know some programming fundamentals, have a logical mind, and have a passion for programming, especially in the financial services industry.- During technical interviews, it's okay if you don't get all the logic questions perfectly correct right away. Use the pen and paper they give you to work things out. Talk to them as you're thinking through the problem. They want to see how you solve problems and that you have a logical mind. If you get stuck on a problem, don't freak out... they will give you some hints to help nudge you along the way.- Show them that you're conversational. The Bloomberg culture is all about open communication. If you have a logical mind and you can hold a conversation, they want you on their team.- As with all interviews: Relax, and be confident!!",

You'll be asked to pick a language (C,C++,Java) so pick the one you know THOROUGHLY. Also another interviewee posted about using brainbench.com tests as preparation. DO IT. A majority of the questions are off this site but you have to pay 200 bucks for a full year\u2026\u00a0 subscription. I for one know if I hadn't take the brainbench tests, there is no way I would have passed. The phone interview wasn't any better (Know your data structures, time complexities, and algorithms). Also, be aware of brain teasers. I thought I did horrible on the phone interview but I still got called for an on-site interview. On-site: THEY WILL GRILL YOU! At least that's what they did to me. Best advice is to study from careercup.com and hope they ask those kinds of questions, but in my case they didn't. They asked about balancing binary trees and I knew then itself I wouldn't get the offer and I was right. To me, I felt it was asked on purpose just to screw me since not even Microsoft asked me that kind of question. Other thoughts: the office is incredible looking with all the modern art, I have never seen an office building like that before. No cubicles, just rows of computers with people so it sort of looked like the world war 2 films where they show rows of women helping out in the factories. Also my on-site interview was only ONE interview by 2 r&d recruiters. Others seem to have received several interviews throughout the day, so I don't how they decide that.",

        "details": "The entire hiring process consisted of three phases.The first phase is an online multiple choice test covering basic programming skills and questions on analytical thinking (of the type you'll normally see in a GRE or GMAT test). There were about 30-35 questions and I was given a maximum of 3 minutes for each question.The second phase is a phone interview. They questioned me in detail about my resume, all my\u2026\u00a0 projects, and asked me to choose one from the different projects listed in my resume. They then went into quite some detail about the project, asking me to describe what I did, the major challenges, how I planned the development, and how I tested the code. After that were some basic technical questions. They will definitely ask you which programming languages among the ones listed on your resume you are most comfortable with and quiz you in detail about it. Since this round is on the phone, they normally will not ask you to write any code, nor will they give you any code. Apart from programming language concepts for one or two languages, there will be some questions on sorting and searching algorithms and data structures, like hash tables, BSTs and their complexities, their advantages, disadvantages etc.The final phase consists of two or three in-house interviews.There will be a round of HR interview which is usually 1:1. Be aware that I was asked in very minute details about everything on my resume. I did expect to be quizzed about these things, but not in such minute details. There are the usual HR questions like why do you want to join Bloomberg, where do you see yourself in 5 years, why should we hire you (asked in a very curt manner to really catch you off guard) etc. so be well prepared for those.Then comes a technical interview round, which is usually conducted by two of their engineers. They will ask you which is the language or languages you are most proficient with, and then quiz you on that. Be aware that you should only say you are proficient in a certain language if you really are proficient in that. There are no bonus points for claiming to know more languages and then not being able to prove your proficiency, and if you can't you will most likely not be hired. The logic is that they want to know how good you really are in things you claim to be really good at. They will usually ask you to write code for two or three problems. They may start with a simple coding question, before moving on the more complicated programs (usually involving recursion or use of a data structure). The emphasis is on being able to write clean and efficient code, along with the use of an efficient algorithm for solving the problem. They will definitely ask you the reasoning behind writing the code (sometimes line by line). There is also emphasis on low level concepts (like how the stack, heap, data segment works, what's stored in there, how the Stack Pointer behaves in different situations etc). Along with writing code, they may write down some code snippets, and ask you if it will compile, if there are any errors, what those errors are, why they come out etc. My preferred languages were C and C++ so they asked me some seemingly odd code snippets to test my understanding of the mechanisms involved in inheritance, polymorphism, templates, operator overloading. There may also be a few questions on the STL. Also related to both containers and memory management will be questions about the ownership of pointers or objects placed in containers, what delete and new do etc. There will be questions related to algorithms and data structures as well. These could either be by themselves or they could be as a part of a programming problem. Be sure about the complexities of all the basic sorting and searching algorithms and data struct operations too since these may be useful is such situations. Finally, they will ask a few puzzles (usually just one or two) to test your problem solving capability. The entire interview will last about 1-1.5 hours (depending on how well you're doing). Most likely, the interviewers are going be really skeptical about your answers (regardless of whether you're screwing up or you're near perfect) - they want to know how confident you are about your answers. Don't panic, this is normal. Just be sure of what you're doing, and cross check your code before you tell them that it\u2019s final.If you manage to survive through this technical round there will be an interview conducted by a Sr. Manager. This one is comparatively low stress. Not too technical. Mostly they want to know how well you fit into the team, where you will fit in, your attitude etc. I would suggest that you talk about things like how you planned your projects, how you worked in a team during your project work etc. He/she may also ask you a puzzle/brain teaser, but I wasn't asked any. You are encouraged to ask questions about the position, the company, the work culture, the management etc.",

From my experience, practicing/preparing such programming interview type questions helps a LOT !! It is otherwise difficult to think of solutionsTry not to get stressed out during the main technical round where 2-3 interviewers will collectively interview you. Even if you don't come up with a 100% right answer, still if you can think reasonably well, use logical abilities, you should be able to clear.Most of their work is in C/C++ - though if you have concepts clear with any other language (like Java), it wouldn't matter.I also had an HR interview in the end - standard questions like why Bloomberg? Where do I see myself in the next 5 years? Why would you be a good fit for Bloomberg? I believe Technical interview was much more important for Bloomberg in their hiring criteria. HR interview was more of a formality.Work culture - fast paced, busy - people working long hours in office daily, face time importancePeople - ok - didn't have much time for niceties or socializing - busy people ..didn't go out of their ways to make you feel welcome or at home.- Good compensation and benefits.",

The first set of questions was solely about pointers and how they are referenced / dereferenced in situations; really fundamental stuff but if you're not clear then you're likely to trip up at some point.

Resume review was simple enough as they are not looking for specific backgrounds. They are looking for undergrad and graduate students with an interest in programming and and financial products. Next step is the assessment test which is similar to the logic game section of lsat. They give you three days once you're emailed to take the exam. Its not difficult but I wold suggest doing logic puzzles to prepare. Its about 30 questions and you get 3 minutes for each question. Expect arranging, organizing, and sequencing games. Even a few questions where you draw a letter on a page then get instruction to turn it 90 degrees 45 degrees and so on then pick the image youre left with.

The phone interview consisted first of talking about certain projects\u2026\u00a0 and work experience on my resume, then some programming related questions based on my couple of programming courses, and a couple of brain teaser/puzzles. Use techinterview(dot)com for an excellent resource for these types of questions. I wasn't quite able to answer one of the questions fully, but I talked through the entire thing and got frustratingly close. Very nice interviewer though, helped me out on questions I struggled with.Invited for an on-site interview, where they flew me in and put me up in a pretty nice hotel a few blocks away from the office. Very nice building, great atmosphere, glass doors in all the meeting rooms, cool stuff. First interview was with 2 software devs, who grilled me on a lot of C++ concepts (especially memory management and pointers), that I claimed to know from my self-study, but realized very quickly that I really didn't have a grasp on. it was very difficult for me, but should be a cakewalk for most people experienced in C++. I personally thought I did terribly on this portion of the interview. Be ready to write code on a notepad. One of the interviewers was really nice and helpful, the other seemed like he was having a bad day, and my inability to answer some of his questions quickly seemed to frustrate him even more.Next was a 1:1 with a manager in R&D, who asked me more brain teasers and a few more programming questions, which started off badly like the first interview, but got progressively better.Finally, there was a 1:1 with someone from HR, who asked a simple data structure concept question, but focused more on my resume, past experience, and other typical HR questions. He was really relaxed and put me at ease after a rigorous first couple of rounds of interviews.Advice: Brush up on whichever programming language you are most comfortable with. Don't lie about this! Like very basic theory and syntax, and those little nuances that you might be asked on an AP CS test or an intro CS test in college. Even if one of the on-site interviews goes badly, regroup between rounds and knock the next one out, and they will vouch for you (believe me...)",

        "details": "I applied online for the Financial Software Developer position. The job description said the interview process would be a technical test and an in house interview. The next week I received an email asking me to do an online skill assessment. The website is called select2perform, quite similar to brainbench. My test is on Java since I chose Java as my most proficient language in my online application. I got\u2026\u00a0 3.89 out of 5, in the Proficiency Level of Advanced (3.51-4.50). Percentile of global population is 94, and 91 for company population.After three and half weeks, I got a phone call for an on site interview. It consists of three sessions. The first two are mainly technical, with some behavioral questions such as why I want to work for Bloomberg. In the first one, they asked a little bit about my previous projects, some concepts questions, and data structures. Then I was asked to write some code. They said I could do it either iteratively or recursively. I chose to use loop, and they asked about the reason, and what were the potential problems of doing it recursively. In the end, they asked some logic questions, which were not very hard. In the second interview with a couple of senior R&D people, after some general questions, I was asked to write some more code. They asked my idea first, and then pointed out conditions in which the idea wouldn\u2019t work, so I needed to modify it. After they were satisfied with the idea, I wrote the code. Then they asked how I could make sure the code is correct, etc. They did not need you to be perfect in syntax, and you can write pseudo code. The last session was with the HR. Typical behavioral questions, and it was very positive experience. I asked questions about the role, the company and the recruiting process. She said usually a decision would be made quite fast, typically in about three days, and if they were uncertain about a candidate, they might have another phone interview.The next day they called to make an offer and I accepted it.",

When completing your application form, you will have to chose which programming language you BEST know. This will affect your online test. I choose C++ as my best language and was invited to complete an online assessment test.Some people said that their online assessment test consisted of figure orientation, logic, math problem questions. My online\u2026\u00a0 test was way more DIFFICULT than that, and consisted of C++ questions ONLY. Test included questions on virtual functions, friendship, template, catching exception, class access, constructors and destructors, memory heap. In my opinion you have to have a CS major with strong understanding of C++ fundamentals to get this test right.I got a final score of 2.75/5.0 which is a 'Proficient level' according to Previsor/BrainBench, but got rejected.",

As I had previous experience with Java I selected it as my strongest language. The following day they sent me an email with instructions to take an online skills assessment. Reading this forum, I practiced a few IQ/Intelligence test with good results so I felt\u2026\u00a0 confident to take the test. I took the test and to my surprise it was all Java programming questions (syncronisation, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, analysing pieces of code, etc). The questions where very specific and not about general OO programming concepts eg. Which one of the following is NOT polymorphic behavior? As I've been out of practice a bit in hands on programming I really struggled with the test. Basically I didn't remember clearly the syntax and got confused with some sentences. My recommendation is that you should study throughly your programming language selection and be ready for tricky questions.",
