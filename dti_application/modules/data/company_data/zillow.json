Disappointing, as I have no idea what they were looking for that I didn't do. I heard this complaint from other reviewers, but I assumed that they just solved the problem the fastest way -- I thought for sure having tests, comment blocks, and code structured for use in an application would impress enough for an interview.",

The first two are software engineers, the third is a Senior SDE and the last one is a manager (he did my second phone screen). From other reviews I guess if you didn't do well in your first two interviews you would not see the manager after all. Overall I enjoy the interview process. People are generally pretty nice, and the view was so great from the windows.Before I leave their office, my recruiter came in and told me that I would hear back in a week (\"early next week\", she said). However I did not receive anything by Jan 28. Two days later on Jan 30, I received an e-mail saying that the position was filled, and that they would contact me should their needs change. I guess I did convince them that I qualified in the interviews, but they already handed out too many offers to people who interviewed before I did so I was already interviewing for a \"substitute position.\" I do understand that's how hiring works, but I'm still disappointed. I love Seattle, I really want that position, and I cannot stop thinking what would happen if they process my phone interviews faster...",

In one of my interviews, the interviewer asked me a question and as I wrote out and described my solution I could see him working on his smartphone out of the corner of my eye. Then when I looked over at him to check in 5 minutes later he was dozing off. Pretty discouraging.
