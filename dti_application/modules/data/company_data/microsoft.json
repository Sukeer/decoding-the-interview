These agencies will only take Canadian citizens and will not sponsor you for any visa if you require one.The interview was 1st telephonic\u2026\u00a0 and then I was an international candidate going from Vancouver to Seattle. The recruiting agency nor microsoft paid for my travel to the interview which was the 2nd round, in person. This was a white board question (question details below).The interviewers were in a haste and didn't actually know about my interview. I was left in the lobby for 1.15 hour with no food or water, since I was just an interviewee.I had travelled by train from Vancouver (Canada) to Seattle for a 1 hour whiteboard test which Microsoft was strict about. In total I travel-led 17 hours for a 1 hour interview with Microsoft and it was horrible.I advice that whoever goes to such interviews from Canada to US, ask all details to the original head hunting agencies like:1. How many rounds will the interview be.2. How much commission will be cut from your salary (yes commission is taken from the employee's salary on a monthly basis)3. You are mostly underpaid compared to what normal US citizens are paid.4. If its a contract to hire, its a risk, what can the recruiting agency do to resolve Visa issues.5.

        "details": "I went through the college recruiting process. Microsoft was among the companies that set up stations at our computer science major recruiting fair where I signed up. The first round was on campus: lasted about 40 minutes, and was easy for a computer science major. About a week later, a recruiter emailed me to tell me that I was being invited for on-site interviews in Redmond (Seattle), WA. The recruiters\u2026\u00a0 are extremely fast and helpful in communicating; interestingly, Microsoft's recruiting process outdoes other companies (Google, FB etc) completely in efficiency and generosity. You're flown out to Redmond and stay in a really comfy hotel with a generous spending budget.Now, it's good to know how on-site interviews work: you begin your day early by meeting with your recruiter, who you should befriend since they are \"on your side\", so to speak, and their input can matter in the decision process. Then, you have consecutive technical interviews lasting about an hour each. You don't have to do perfectly in all of them, but I had a very strong feeling that the first 2 are the most important. The first one is particularly important. If you are doing well, you will get a 4th and sometimes 5th technical interview. If you're lucky, you will afterwards get a final interview with a manager of sometimes, like in my case, a really impressive big boss type person. This big boss can basically hire you on the spot, and its pretty cool that you get to meet someone like this.Don't forget that for Microsoft, as well as other companies, several things matter for college recruiting; your interviews, first and foremost, but also your coursework, projects, grades, internship experiences, etc. Also, knowing more math than average CS majors helps.The next day I found out that I was getting an offer, and the next business day after that my recruiter called me with the details over the phone. Microsoft really, really wants smart new grads. The company and culture has REALLY been improving the past few years, and they want smart new grads to keep that up. Offers are actually more generous than at other competing companies.In my case, you might really like the people you meet or have a personal connection with the big boss type person at the end, in which case your offer could potentially be for the team you actually interviewed with. In this case, you have a choice whether you want to be with that team or go back in the general \"hired\" pool which is distributed into teams at some later point.",

On the day of the interview a Microsoft cab picks you up from the airport and takes you to their Recruiting building. There were many other candidates, but they were mainly for internships.You meet with your designated recruiter who is your point of contact post-interview. As mentioned in other reviews, talk nicely with this recruiter and highlight your skill and more importantly your passion for Microsoft. This recruiter has a say in your final yes or no decision.Had 5 interviews on-site with 5 senior engineers/managers. Each interviewers experience at Microsoft progresivelly increased- ranging from 10 years to 25 years. Each interview is for 1 hour, in which the interviewer will talk about his role/experience for 10-15 minutes, ask about your experience for 10-15 minutes and the rest would be a coding question.These interviews were not exceptionally difficult. I felt and had heard that more than cracking every coding questions, at Microsoft, it is more about 1. Being very passionate and excited to join Microsoft 2. Writing clean quality code with comments, main driver function, corner cases, talking as you write and testing the code 3. Presenting yourself professionally.You have the write background if you ve made it on-site. Focus on that background, while continually showing your excitment about being there and wanting to join Microsoft. Have a solid answer to \"Why Microsoft?\" Ask them smart questions which show your thinking ability. Before starting to code on whiteboard, ask clarifying questions about the problem, talk about your design to the problem, point out any limitations. Start coding with proper comments, spaces, use good variable/functions names etc.You will hear back from the recruiter in 1-3 days. Microsoft gives a generous offer, with bonuses and RSUs, benifits, however, if you have a competing offer do negotiate. You will surely get a higher package.",

I had three interviews scheduled before the lunch break and three interviews after.All the interviews were standard - straightforward whiteboard coding or brainteasers. Many of my interviews ran over time (one ran 45 mins over). I ended up not having time for lunch at all - my previous interview had run over and only half an hour\u2026\u00a0 of time had been scheduled, so I had 15 mins to purchase lunch in the lobby and run back upstairs to make the next interview. I would advise other candidates to bring their own lunches - the cafe was extremely crowded and it took me the entire 15 mins to get food and pay.I didn't have a complete schedule for the day, so I was unable to give the name of my next interviewer to the receptionist and ended up waiting in the lobby until my interviewer eventually came out to investigate.Since my interviews had run over time, my day was extended by an hour and I did the final coding interview after my meeting with the hiring manager (which was supposed to be the end of the day).I would encourage other candidates to brush up on their basic coding skills (string manipulation etc.) and brainteasers - the interviews were not design heavy. I would also encourage candidates to get a copy of their schedules in advance in case things go awry as security is very tight in the building. If I were to interview again, I would also bring snacks just in case.",

They set you up with a nice hotel in Bellvue, WA and a rental car (if chosen). Pay for all your meals - an allowance of $75 a day or something in that area. Day\u2026\u00a0 of the interview comes, they pick candidates up together in a party bus infront of the hotel. The bus had flashing strobe lights and neon green lighting at 7am in the morning. It was funny if anything, but quite silly.Throughout the whole thing, I never get told what I was interviewing for. They finally told us and I was COMPLETELY uninterested in the team. That spiked my confidence down. I could've saved MS $2,000+ for my trip if they told me that upfront, I would've declined. Even after talking to all the interviewers, it clearly wasn't for me. So how they got that from my resume I'm not sure.But, that doesn't mean I didn't give it my best shot. Four 45 minute interviews with 5 minute breaks in between for food/drink. The atmosphere was wonderful. It was a great confidence booster. I felt awesome and confident I could nail the position anyway, and after the first interviewer I was told that mobility was a nice perk of the job without even asking! The interviewers started with questions about me, my past projects, strengths/weaknesses, technical questions next, and left maybe a minute or two for questions about them.Technical questions were:-Implement circular array with a k-step elimination-Return sub-array with a maximum continuous sum-Check for a tic-tac-toe winner given a matrix-Without knowing the size of an array, find an element.Strongest interview I think I've ever had. Yet I was told 2 work-days after leaving that they passed on me. I think I fell short on the last interview, with the element in the array, because I didn't realize try-catch was an option to use in a interview. My previous work experience does NOT use try-catch loops, that's a big no-no, they're super slow. I've always used assertions. I got halfway through the question before that and he was unhelpful in pointing out options to solve the problem. He was also a very off-putting interviewer, and didn't seem organized.The other 3 interviewers I had - we laughed, we discussed interesting topics like AI/machine-learning, I nailed the technical questions from start to finish with room for testing and optimization, it was a great time. So my best guess is that last guy talked bad of me, and I was told you need all 4 to basically love you to get in. Waste of time, waste of money on their part.Summary - super easy interviews with laid back atmosphere, great hospitality, but you're left in the dark with what you're interviewing for until the day of and all it takes is 1 interviewer to be stubborn and unreasonable.",

        "details": "I am a mechanical engineer by training with past programming experience for primarily personal projects (video games and such) in multiple languages. I'm currently in a PhD program finishing up the masters portion. I casually chatted with a recruiter at a university career fair who told me that he will pass on my resume and that there \"may\" be something for me at Microsoft but he doesn't know what. He\u2026\u00a0 told me to contact the university recruiter in a few days and she might be able to help me better. They called me for a screening interview for an internship the day after.I'm not - what I like to call - \"classically trained\" when it comes to computer science. I prepared for the screening interview by going through the MIT OCW Algorithms and Data Structures course and also reading Miller and Ranum's \"Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures.\" The screening interview went better than expected. Among other things, I was asked to design a parking lot and write code for detecting palindromes.A few weeks later I got a call for a final round interview. It took a while for them to schedule an interview and they gave me a date which was 3 days after a major deadline with my sponsor and so I requested a later date. The scheduler worked with my availability and got me a date that worked. They flew me to Redmond for an interview with the Bing team (I wasn't given that information until the morning of the interview). I was supposed to get 3 to 5 interviews. My first interviewer was late because he missed an email sent by the receptionist. Everything after that went smoothly. I got through all 5 interviews. The third interview was over lunch (we wrote code after, not during). The fifth interview was with a program manager. The questions seemed relatively easy. The topics were: queue design, common ancestor search in a tree with no underlying structure, mixed uni and multi byte character strings, detection of unique addresses, and linked list scanning and element removal. Some interviewers wanted me to just solve a problem as well as I could. Others were looking for a discussion of the problem (one of which was actually very interesting and have the interviewer some new ideas).At the very end I asked the hiring manager some subtle questions about my performance and what kind of competition I was facing. It's nice to be told that there is a \"high probability\" of them making an offer :)",

Phone interview consisted of fairly basic data structure questions involving stacks/queues and things like bucket sort. I was surprised by how tailored to my resume all of the other questions were, though. So make sure that you know everything you put on your resume well enough to speak strongly about. I made this mistake but\u2026\u00a0 it was apparently minor enough since I got invited for onsite interviews.Flew out to Seattle within 2 weeks of my phone interview. We stayed in the commons and hung out with a large (>40) group of other applicants for various positions--mostly SDE intern. It was pretty neat as we got to ride a party bus to the campus. The waiting room for all the interns was very nice. Large touchscreen TV for fruit ninja, another large surface table for other minigames, catered snacks and drinks.I was an afternoon interviewee so we went to lunch first. The Microsoft lunch area is very nice. We got a $10 voucher for any restaurant type establishment. Everything had a bit of an upscale mall food court feel in a good way. Drinks were also free for all employees, which is cool.I was interviewing for a position in MSIT, which is Microsoft's internal tooling software teams. Things like the enterprise e-commerce division and others. Three technical interviews which were equal parts conversational and coding and one completely conversational job fit. Again my resume topics were discussed quite a bit more than I expected.\u00a0My interviewers were very interested in projects that I had worked on in groups and broad design choices we had made, so if you have any, be ready to speak to them.The interviews went well enough, though I think I choked in the last technical interview. They gradually make your solutions more and more difficult by adding restrictions like runtime and allowed data structures. It got to a point where I simply didn't have an answer, but that might be what they're looking for.2 business days later, I got a call with an offer from my recruiter for an SDE position.

I was attending a conference in a different city\u2026\u00a0 the week before my interview but it was no problem for them to adjust my flight for my convenience.Everything was really nice, they do really take care of their employees and potential ones as well.On the interview day, I woke up around 6 and went out to the lobby of the hotel around 6:45 am , there were other people who are also waiting to get picked up by Microsoft. We arrived at the building where interviews are held. Breakfast at 7:30, mingle with other interviewees, and then interview started at 8. Each 45 minutes long with 15 min breaks in between. Lunch at noon, we all headed to the \"Commons\" (or whatever they call it) it's the main area of the campus. Where we ate was giant food court style, all sorts of food available. etc.After lunch, we headed back to the interview building and they told us some logistics of what's next. 1.5 days later, I got an email asking when I'll be available to \"chat\" and the next day, my recruiter called and said I got the position.One thing I want to say is that, Redmond + Bellevue is dominated by Microsoft buildings and it seems that you get a lot of respect if you are an Microsoft employee. They even have a \"Microsoft employee only\" counter at the Seattle airport. Blew my mind...

After finishing with the code, he wants me to tell him the pro and cons that I choose this recursion algorithm. I talked about he efficiency of writing and understanding in the format of recursion, and the con is algorithm complexity. He then asked me how to improve the algorithm, I did not come up with a good alternative algorithm, so I told him I can implement the recursion in a distributed fashion. The pro is scalability, and the con is extra cost on machines. At last, he ask me to say something about testing - how to possibly test the class I just wrote.

When looking for full time, I contacted the person for any openings in their team. Fortunately, I heard back from them and got a phone screen schedule within one week.Phone Screen was easy and mainly focused on the projects i wrote in my resume and some algorithmic problems\u2026\u00a0 related with those projects.Within one week, I heard back from them that I was through first round and need to come to Seattle for face to face interview. They were really helpful in scheduling the interview according to my convenience.Microsoft takes care of their their employees and potential employees as well in my case. Wonderful and systematic scheduling. I landed in Seattle.Whole day was set aside for interviews, I had 5 in total including the famous 5th interview which is a positive sign as mentioned by many here. First interview, little variation on the level order traversal which i was able to code it with some help from the recruiter who was really nice. You will have to write the code on board so I would suggest do some \"Actual\" coding preferably on some IDE which shows only syntactical errors and runs the program. Eclipse is sometimes too helpful which let's us forget minor mistakes.Second round was a real life project problem related with quick ip lookup, for which I have default solution, Tries. I told each and every pros and cons of using tries and the interviewer was satisfied. I stumbled a little while implementing it but eventually was able to do that with of course the help of interviewer.Oh yeah one more thing each interview is approximately 45 mins to 60 mins long and lunch time discussion is also part of the recruiting process. So don't lose your head thinking that it's not part of the process.3rd interview which included the lunch discussion as i mentioned above. I was not aware of it but since interviewer only discussed my projects on resume, i was happy to talk about them. But was really thinking why the lunch is so much work. Later i realised when interviewer said, let's go back to the office and continue the discussion. This was the toughest round as interviewer went in to very specific details about my projects so one tip do remember some of the tools names, just to name drop them ;)4th round was a short one as the 3rd one went for one and half hours. This one was comparatively lighter and mainly focused on design problems.Then came, the nerve wrecking wait as they told me to wait so that they all can discuss how i performed and decide on the last interview with the 2nd line manager. Thankfully manager came soon and ask me to wait for 2nd line manager. That discussion was very informal sort as he was selling me Microsoft and why I should come and work there. Happy sign always ! :)Then I came back to my awesome hotel as I had my flight back same day in the evening.Almost next day itself the HR contacted me and I missed her call. I really thought I did'nt get through but thankfully Hr called me back next day and told me I am through !!Only advice I can give you is \"CODE\" ! there is no way around it! If you want to work as SDE you need to know Algorithms and Data Structures ! Language is no issue but you must know how to implement it. At least able to discuss why to us and why not to use a particular data structure.",

The interview day was long, I had a series of interviews each testing different areas.All of the interviews were with senior engineers with 5 - 20 years experience.The first interview covered SQL, I was given a schema and asked to point out any issues/improvements and then write some queries.The next 2 covered CS based questions like algorithms, runtime analysis .. etc.Next I had a lunch interview where I was able to talk with another engineer about his role and get a little more of a sense of the day to day life.Finally I had one more algorithms based interview and that was the end.Overall I found that the interview process was very well done and the hr staff at Microsoft were really easy to deal with.

Both were really pleasant, the engineering interview was a simple programming task done on a laptop: write a function which given a string will return if it contains correctly matched open and closed parentheses. Expanded to include other types of\u2026\u00a0 brackets and return if all were correctly matched.I heard back very quickly informing me I had made it through to the final round on site assessment day. Couldn't make the first couple of interview dates offered so was eventually invited to travel to Redmond for an interview day at the main offices. Organizing travel was very easy and everyone involved was incredibly helpful.On the day, arrived at building 111 for mid morning. Was guided around campus and taken to the commons for a free lunch. We visited the visitors center and the company store and were invited to buy up to $120 of discount merch.We then returned to 111 for the interviews. We were each allocated a division we'd be interviewing for (this was not shared before the first interview). We were each interviewed by four interviewers who asked a variety of question covering fundamentals of computer science and some advanced material. We had a ten minute gap between each interview in which the examiners compared notes before we were launched into the next one.Asked technical questions on a number of topics, sorting algorithms and their time and space complexities, binary trees and binary search trees, low level computer scheduling and atomicity of operations, and an abstract data type question. I've provided examples of a small number of questions below.These were mixed in among other behavioral questions, attitudes, what do you do for fun, what's important when implementing software, how to interact with team members etc.It was generally very broad with lots of interesting questions; I wouldn't say especially hard but thats all relative... If you know the field and are well prepared you shouldn't find anything too tough...Don't worry about making mistakes, I know I sure made a couple, the key is checking back over your solutions as you go, work with test cases and when you identify a shortcoming, work out how you can fix it. TALK OUT LOUD! They don't care if you get stuck in a circle as long as they can see your thought process and why it's happening. If you've overlooked something they will happily drop a hint and see if you can rectify.My biggest tip would be friendly and relaxed, make it more of a conversation than a rigid interview. I almost got the feeling they were more interested in my personality than what I wrote on the board, so make it easy for them to like you: At the end of the day the big question they're asking themselves is, 'would I like to work alongside this person', not just 'can he do the work'.Overall, my interview was incredibly positive, everyone was super friendly and did their best to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. The company was very generous with arranging travel, accommodation etc and first and foremost Microsoft seemed an incredible place to work. Go for it, give it your best shot, what is there to lose?",

She gave a presentation about Microsoft, the interview schedule, etc. And we started to interview with the engineers at 8:00.There were 4 rounds of interviews, 45 minutes each, with 15 minutes break in between. Afterwards, the whole group went to have lunch together. When we came back, the recruiter talked to us one by one, informing us about the results right away.",

The interviewer was very friendly and asked a lot of questions from my resume and prev work experiences. After that she asked me to design an employee feedback application that would record the employee's goals/ achievements and the manager would review it. I\u2026\u00a0 was asked to come up with design pattern for this problem and think of all possible test cases. It was a very open-ended question so I wasn't sure I covered all. Nevertheless got a call after 15 days asking me to come onsite.I had 4 1:1 technical rounds on-site. All the interviewers were very friendly. They gave us a tour of the campus and took us to the store. They really treat the candidates well and gave us pretty awesome coupons to be used at the store.The interviews were a mixture of coding, design, behavioural, puzzles and resume questions. A lot of distributed network questions were asked. It is good to have an all-rounded preparation. Don't just concentrate on Data structures and OOPS. Some of the questions were:\"How would you design the swimming pool for a resort in Mexico?\"\"What data structure would you use for a website like Ancestry.com and how and why.\" Had to write code for this\"You have a website that displays the stock prices of every company everyday with trends. How would you test the accuracy of data displayed in the website?\"\"You have billions of strings sorted in an array. You don't have any access to it. You just have a method that returns the string pertaining to a index. Use only that method to find the location of a given string\" I started out at 0(n^2) and kept on improving to o(logn)After that, they gave me the results very next day.

        "details": "The communication started through career fair. When I gave my Resume to one of their representative (current Engineer at Microsoft), he quickly asked few questions to get to know about my background. Later he told me that he would forward this to one of the recruiter and he will contact me if there is a suitable match. I had to raise my eyebrow here, cause the guy has my Resume\u2026\u00a0 and he asked me several questions. This alone should be enough to proceed ahead with interview or no interview. Reading other posts, it seems MS conducts onsite campus interviews, then why forward to recruiter. Perhaps, due to lower reputation of my university, they do not want to spend too much time interviewing people onsite.A couple of weeks later, I got an email to schedule a phone interview. At last, something is better than nothing as I get about half an hour to prove my capacity. I have gone through interview posts here on Glassdoor and I could not find any details on phone interviews. Most were either college interviews or people talking about their onsite interviews after passing phone interview. In any case, I prepared myself with the questions posted and later on I realized those were overkill for the phone interview.Now, I have gone through plenty of phone interviews with multiple tech giants. In most cases, I have made it to later rounds in phone interview, but no onsite though. Well, I just want to say I have become quite comfortable with these initial interviews, both technically and behaviorally.The interviewer called on time and we started with discussing my background. This was already done when I submitted my Resume, so I see no point in reiterating all this. Although, I was asked similar questions in my past interviews, but on those occasions, I did not forward my Resume personally and the initial phone calls were the first time when I spoke to someone inside the company.Next I was asked several semi-technical and behavioral questions. Most of these questions are already discussed elsewhere, therefore I will not emphasize much on those. However, I will mention some of them below, cause I think it's on these questions I may have under performed. As for other questions, I am sure \"Design a Table\", \"Test an Elevator\" and \"Determining Apple, Orange and Apple-Orange from incorrectly labelled boxes\" should ring a bell or you will certainly encounter them if you search on internet.Few days later, I got the usual no offer email. The only positive thing I can take is they told me to reapply in 6 months. From what I know, they usually give a 1 year clause, therefore this was a good rejection, I hope.I did give some ridiculous answers which could be a good reason for rejection. I will discuss them in Question sections below. Perhaps you guys could judge if this is certainly worth getting a rejection.",

The second interviewer was late by about 15 mins while I was waiting in the lobby.\u2026\u00a0 The person invited me to his room and started the interview. The question was not clear at all and the person just turned her back on me and started typing an email on her desktop. I thought she was giving me some time to think but when I had a solution, I tried to let her know by calling out her name. She did not acknowledge! Can you believe it??? I was literally standing behind her for 10 minutes telling her that I have a solution. She did not like my solution so moved onto the next question. While I had different solutions, she had something in mind (Note: She was still typing on her computer faced against me)\u00a0At last, when I asked what was the solution to the second question, she was like 'Thats too many lines of code. I cannot explain'.\u00a0The rudest interview of my life. After that, it pretty much set the mood for me for the rest of the day. The other interviews were fine and I was really upset.\u00a0I even contacted the recruiter and let him know about my feedback but haven't gotten any reply yet.

        "details": "Initially turned in my resume during a campus career fair. Approximately two weeks later I was emailed by a recruiter who asked me to participate in an on-campus interview (i.e., first round).The campus interview was with someone who wasn't a recruiter and had clear technical expertise. This interview lasted approximately 25-30 minutes. We mostly talked about items on my resume, whether or not I faced any unique challenges and if\u2026\u00a0 so, how I overcame them. This was a very conventional interview. Upon the conclusion, I was asked a technical question.About three weeks later, I was emailed again by a different recruiter who asked me if I was available to fly out to Redmond, WA for the second round interview. I had a very compact window to interview within, and the recruiters did a great job setting everything up within my constraints.On interview day, the first step is to meet with another recruiter who is on-site, who will discuss the group / team you will be interviewing with, and answer any other questions you may have at the time. This recruiter is also the one who will tell you the results, and work further with you should you get an offer. After meeting the recruiter, you take a personal shuttle to the buildings where your interviewers are. Mine were all in the same building. Next you meet with 3-5 interviewers, and one of the interviews is a lunch interview. You are told beforehand that each interviewer passes on comments to the next one, presumably so they can confirm / deny a weakness.For me, the first interviewer didn't want to talk about my resume at all. He was more or less the manager of the group and was very blunt about the skills he was looking for. Some non-technical questions were: \"What would you change about Windows?\", \"What do you read to stay on top of the latest technology?\", \"What are some examples of trending applications?\". Then he went to the coding problems. One a mathematical proof, and the second more coding oriented.The next interview was over lunch, and this interviewer asked me initially about my research, but quickly started trending towards questions that were more oriented towards the group. After lunch we went back to his office and I was asked another coding problem.The third interview was more theoretical. The interviewer briefly talked about my research and that it looked interesting, and then we went into an open-ended math / optimization problem.After the third interview, I was told that I would not be seeing the fourth interviewer (this means you failed), and I was taken back to HR to discuss the day with the recruiter. I should point out that the recruiter was very helpful and looked into other groups that might have been a better fit.Overall, the interview was very challenging. You absolutely need to be prepared to code and solve difficult problems. The second round is not about what you have done, but rather what you can do now, in a high-pressure situation. Also, you are told that you can code in any language, but in reality, you need to be able to code in C/C#. Not being familiar with either, I tried to use Python so as to not get bogged down in syntax, but it was generally not well received.",

        "details": "I submitted my resume online. But it was at the end of year (in december) and the HR said they will be contacting me only in jan or Feb as they normally freeze the hiring fr new grads at that time. As said they contacted me in Feb and asked scheduled a time for a phone screening with one of the dev engineers.The phone screening was normal. The person who\u2026\u00a0 contacted me was easy to communicate with. He asked about myself, the projects i worked with and what are my interests and what products that interests me and which team I would like to work with in Microsoft. This was to get an overall idea of where your interest lies in and which team would be a fit for you. Followed by it was a simple algorithm question on linked list to delete a node and to do it in optimized way. Have to give out all the corner cases.After nearly two weeks they called me for an onsite interview. And the process was pretty smooth. Every day i used to receive mails from HR of the things that I need to do and about the travel ad stay. And even received a 'best wishes' mail from them prior to the day of interview.On the day of interview, I was interviewed by 5 people. It involves both technical and behavioral questions. Interview was held at cubicles of the respective engineers and managers.First interview was about detailing my resume. He asked about all the projects that was in my resume. So be well prepared. And also asked if I had any conflicts with other people on the course of project work and how I resolved it. Followed by it was white board coding problems. First it was about how i approach the problem and then have to write a code. Asked about time complexity.Second interview was about the projects again. And he asked me particularly about my internship project. And then asked to solve a problem. We discussed the pros and cons of my approach and then asked to write code. Asked for time complexity. For one problem he asked about the downfall for the approach and then asked if i could find a way to resolve it. I gave him the solution and was moved to the third interview.Third interview was lunch interview. I had no clue about the team I am going to interview with before that morning. And that is the policy of Microsoft not to let the candidates know the team they are going to interview with. So you cant research about them. And so lunch interview is all about you talking. Be ready to question and speak. It all about it. How much you are interested in the job and the team and how good are you at communicating. I started with business model of the team, architecture, technologies used, compared with other technologies, competitors, new features. I also commented on the negative aspects of the product and compared with the features of others. But don't stop talking.If you do well with first three interviews then you will be invited for the fourth one.My fourth interview was more about coming up with my data structure for the problem and then solving a given problem and writing an API. Try to start with normal approach and to make it optimized. And speak your thoughts, even if it may be wrong. They are more than willing to help you out if you are struck. Again this one involved the conflicts you encountered and your influence on any project. It need not be something big. Just show them that you have your opinion and you are in a position to voice it.If you get through the fourth interview , you will be invited for fifth one with the dev manager or director of the team.This one is not technical, but purely you interest again. It was again 60 min of interview.And after one day I was informed that I got selected.",

They say that if you get 5 interviews and if the last one is with a senior manager, then you'd get a job. NOPE. NEVER. I got five interviews and the last one was with a very nice senior person working there for 35 years and still I\u2026\u00a0 got rejected.Went to Redmond a few months ago in a snowy winter day! There were five interviews:1) A very strict (but polite) person, no smile on the face, explicitly telling me that he wont help me and wont give me any hints. It was all about quickly writing a bug-free C++ code to find a pattern in a string, implementing a post order tree traversal with and without recursion and a few research/design problems.2) An extremely nice korean guy who asked about hash tables/lookup/insert/collision in HT and implementation in C++. There was another question about writing all permutations of a given string.3 and lunch interview) A very nice person, willing to help: He told me to develop an algorithm for finding whether a matrix has some properties or not. It was 5 months ago and I forgot the question. I could solve the question but he was looking for a more efficient algorithm. He was willing to help and gave me hints but time was up and he gave me to the next interviewer. he told me that I was going to the right direction.4) The fourth interviewer was very odd. I hope his behavior was planned/intentional and he is not like this. From our conversation, it was obvious that this guy is very smart. He wrote a long input string with lots of delimiters in the white board and asked me to write a c-code to change the given string it to another format based on some rules. It was a horribly vague, twisted question with lots of unknowns and exceptions. In the interview, he was taking nap time to time and he left the room at least three times. Again I hope that this was a test to see my reaction. The reason that I hope for the best is that at the end of the interview, he was the only person who gave me very honest feedbacks and compliments. But if it is not the case, that was awfully/extremely rude. So he passed me to the final interviewer...5) a senior manager, working in MS for 35 years. Very cool, very smart and very fun, It could be easily observed by the flags/decoration in the room/some wine on the table in his room!!! By the way, I didnt have any whatsoever behavioral questions during my day. So this time, he just started chatting with me which I guess was the behavioral part of the interview. Talking about everything except work, about big corporations, hacking!! and so on. It was truly an amazing experience with that person.Based on the book, I surely have gotten the job, but ....One week later, I got rejected.",

First there was a very simple phone interview in which they asked some pretty varied questions, such as how I would explain the internet to a young kid and how I would test a vending machine. They always finish with a small logic puzzle which are pretty easy and\u2026\u00a0 you've probable even worked with if you've been programming for a while.Afterwards, you're supposed to fly to Redmond but they gave me a 50/50 thing, where I would take 2-3 interviews by phone to screen you, and if you pass you fly to Redmond for the last batch. The interviewer by phone asked me some questions about pointers, recursion, and some basic data structures, but he took it as in depth as possible. Definitely brush up on your Data Structures.After this, I got sent to Redmond where I had 2 interviews. One was with someone from MS Office. She was a charming lady who just portrayed peace to me, so it was really nice. She asked me to write a pre-order traversal that worked iteratively instead of recursively. This wasn't bad at all but again: data structures.My next interview was with a guy from server (Azure to be more specific). He asked me to make a Stack, but he took it down to ever little. Since I wanted it do it with a Linked List he asked me to implement a Linked List first and just kept squeezing every little detail out. Afterwards, he asked me to make it thread safe which was very easy. Then he through a trick question at me about how exceptions would make my stack fail...and I didn't get the answer.About 45 mins later a guy from HR took me to a room to tell me that I didn't get the position. He was very cool about it and MS Staff is extremely friendly, which is somewhat bad since it's harder to read how you do. All in all, great experience and I hope to make it next year.",

I flew out for their 2 day interviewing event for the Online Services Division, during which they comp you plane tickets, hotel for 2 nights, money for cabs, and stipends for meals. They take you out in a limo bus on the night before interviews to \"meet recruiters\", but overall that was pretty useless and you basically just start stressing out with all your fellow interviewees. The next day you have 3-5 45 minute interviews (each is 1:1). They're pretty difficult, but the nice thing is they give you your results (offer or no offer) right after you finish.

        "details": "My interview was for a MSIT SDE position, so my experience may have been somewhat different from interviews with product groups.I had my resume given to a recruiter by a classmate who was recently hired by Microsoft. I was given a phone interview in December, and on the phone was told that I would be contacted for an in-person interview at the Redmond Campus.I flew in on a Thursday, and\u2026\u00a0 Microsoft put on a meet-and-greet event for all of the candidates. Free food and open bar, plus a chance to get to meet current Microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. It was a lot of fun, and I think helps candidates relax and gain a bit of confidence before interview day.In January, I received information and scheduling for my on-site interview. Microsoft paid for my flight, hotel, food and other costs. In February I was informed the interview would consist of four 1 hour interviews, at the end of which I would find out whether or not I would be given an offer.I flew in on a Thursday, and Microsoft put on a meet-and-greet event for all of the candidates that evening. There was free food and open bar, plus a chance to get to meet current Microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. It was a lot of fun, and really helped me relax and gain a bit of confidence before the interview day. We were given packets that had our schedule for the next day, stating whether you would interview in the morning or afternoon group.**The Interview**We were shuttled to the Microsoft campus, where we had breakfast and a brief meeting with the recruiters before our first interview.First Interview:Met with a SDET who had been with Microsoft for over a decade, and had been a PM previously. Very friendly, asked mainly general questions about my experience, what I'm interested in, etc. Then, he asked me to design a subscription service system. After asking a few questions I found that he wanted the tech stack that I would build it on, with justifications for some of the choices. Overall, this interview went very well.Second Interview:I met with a PM who asked me some more general questions, asked me about a previous project I had worked with. No technical questions, and this interview also went quite well.Third Interview:Meeting with a SDET who asked me about past experience, how I got into software engineering (since I'm an MIS major). He then asked me how I would test the whiteboard, followed by how to test a piece of paper. Finally he asked me to write a method to remove all instances of a certain character from a string. He then modified it asking for how to remove a string of sequential characters from a string. The testing questions threw me a bit initially, but I still felt pretty good by the end of the interview.Fourth Interview:Met with an SDE who briefly asked me about my resume, then jumped into questions on OOP. Can you explain OOP to me. What is a class? What is an object? What is multiple inheritance and what are its drawbacks? Does C# or Java allow multiple inheritance? How is this problem solved? Finally she asked me to reverse a linked list, which I completely botched. I had seen it several times before, but just couldn't get the algorithm right. I didn't solve it before our time ran out, and had to leave it unfinished.At this point, I was feeling pretty nervous about my outcome. We were taken to lunch and when we returned, we were told our results would be given to us shortly. My name was called first, which I assumed meant the worst. The recruited told me, \"I hate to do this to you, but we want you to meet with one more member of the team.\" I had a final interview with another SDE, he was very direct and jumped right into the technical question. I was asked to write a method to find the max int in an unordered binary tree. I nailed this question, which I think got me the offer.I was later told that they sometimes ask for an additional interview to determine fit within the team, how true this is I don't know.I then returned to the lobby to wait a bit more to hear my results, and was finally called back and told I was getting an offer.Final Thoughts / AdviceThe process is pretty intense but also very enjoyable. If you can, make sure to attend the event the night before the interview. It helps you gain confidence, because you get to see them as normal people, not some sort of mythical geniuses. Plus, by being sociable, displaying interest and being excited about the opportunity, you can put yourself in a good position with potential interviewers. My surprise fifth interview was with a guy who I had a pretty good conversation with the night before and joked a bit with during the event.",

        "details": "Applied through the Microsoft website and interviewed on-campus. I was pleased to hear that I was selected to be flown up to Seattle and interview with the online services division (Bellevue, WA not Redmond). I will state early on that I completed the interview process and received no offer - however, with that said, I will be as objective as I can be about the experience.Firstly, understand that although Microsoft\u2026\u00a0 does every single thing possible to try to show how \"fun\" they are, by far the number one thing the interviewers look for is the ability to think and code just like any other large software company. Everyone who says that it's important to be social and personable at Microsoft must have interviewed with a different division. With online services, all that matters is coding, problem solving, and wanting to tackle new problems.During your day you will have four 45 minute interviews, with 15 minute breaks in between. After that you will hear immediately whether or not an offer will be extended. This is absolutely amazing by Microsoft. To have that feedback so instantaneously is incredible and truly first-class of the company. These interviews will be intimidating to say the least and I can virtually guarantee you that you will run into one or two people that you really like and think are cool, and one or two that make you second-guess if you really want to work there.Each interview has a coding question. My four were as follows:1) Given the in-order and preorder traversals of a binary tree, rebuild the tree.2) Given a sparse n-by-m matrix, find the number of distinct paths within that matrix (each cell can be off or on, find the number of distinct sets of connected cells).3) Given the Android 3x3 matrix lock screen, generate all the possible unlock combinations that one can enter.4) Given an array of integers, find all the unique elements.I botched the first question. It was 8AM in the morning when I attempted it and I had been up since 6:30. To be quite honest, I had forgotten to review the tree algorithms. I met with the interviewer and he literally bombarded me with questions. If you say *anything* be prepared to defend it and back it up. There is also a strong sense that you must be very, very interested in working for Microsoft. As one Microsoftie put it, \"the people who work at Microsoft choose to work there because they love Microsoft, it's not that they cannot work for Google or Apple\".There is little to no review of your resume. The emphasis is pretty much solely on your ability to code relatively generic, albeit challenging, programming problems. This can work to your advantage or it can be a disadvantage. To ace the interview, simply read a number of programming problems and study up on the division you are interested in. At one point in time, I was asked: \"if you were given a farm of 1000 computers, say, what problem would you try to solve?\". Find something that Microsoft is trying to solve, or some generic problem in the division for whom you are interviewing.As I was not extended the offer, I cannot precisely tell you what it takes to succeed in the interview. However, here are a couple of observations I made (some of which are listed earlier):1) Read up on the division for whom you are interviewing and understand their business well.2) Read up on many, many coding questions. If you read enough problems, chances are you will have heard a problem similar to the one you are trying to solve.3) I cannot stress this enough, but to succeed you *must* ace the first interview you have. I told you how I botched the first question. I did not think to use recursion. In a later interview I had a question that could have used recursion (implementing a BFS), but I chose the iterative process. The interviewer remarked to me, \"your first interviewer noted that you don't use recursion, why don't you?\". These interviewers talk to each other in between! As such, you must absolutely make a good first impression.If you can interview with Microsoft, it is a cool experience. You get two free nights in a nice hotel room and all your expenses paid. It makes for an awesome trip to Seattle. However, I really wish Microsoft would cut down on the number of people they bring to Seattle. Reading through Glassdoor, you will see *a lot* of people are not extended offers. Why bring these people if you don't extend a great deal of offers? I feel their current system unfairly generates a lot of false hopes.If you are interviewing with the big M, I wish you the best. You will have a fun experience and it will be really cool to even just walk through those doors once. As the guy who told me the sad end-of-day news put it, \"we receive 10,000 resumes a week, and the fact that you made it this far attests to your skills\". Be proud that you received the interview and enjoy your experience!",

        "details": "It is college recruiting. The first interview was in college about 1 hour, one coding problem about sorting, just write the pseudo code in a paper, not so difficult, the pressure is timing. Then asked some questions about projects in my resume, and questions like how do you think to improve some Microsoft products like IE etc. Three weeks later I was informed they will fly me to Redmond for\u2026\u00a0 onsite interview.I flied from Florida and stayed at Seattle for two nights, Microsoft paid all the trip. The first night is a big dinner party with all other candidates over the country and Microsoft managers/employees who will interview us the next day. The dinner is not interview, just casual party with chatting, get familiar with each other, very friendly.At next day all candidates are divided into two groups, interviewed by morning and afternoon separately. I was in afternoon group, the morning is a bus tour for the Microsoft campus, meeting and talking with HR and engineers, introduced the Microsoft life, sports center, science center etc, they want you to like here, treated like we are one of them already. Actually the HR told us once you are on campus interview, that means basically you are qualified to Microsoft, but they only hire top half of us due to high competitiveness.Afternoon interview has 4 turns, about 1 hour each with different development manager. Each turn has coding question of course, write the pseudo code in white board. They are not very difficult, once you are in good hand in algorithm class, it should be OK, the timing and efficiency is the key.Remember I said they only hire top half of the group, solve as many coding questions as you can in one hour with better efficiency, then you will stand out to the top half. I worked OK to the first and second turn, the managers are friendly, and asked question like how do you think about Microsoft, any question/expectation to Microsoft/product etc.But I failed at third turn, my coding solution looks complicated and inefficient, although I worked out, the manager pointed that and introduced better one to me, of course that means mine is not that good. The fourth turn means nothing then, the interviewer not on the interview mood at all, just asked some unimportant coding/question to pass the time.So the result is obvious. All of us know the result right after the interview finished. They call the failed candidate one by one out of the room and told you very regretfully then you can leave. And the other half who still left in the room are offered...This is college hiring, all the candidates are undergraduate/graduate, the experienced one may be different and more difficult. Someone said since the 4 managers are from different team, if one or two are interested in you, then you may be hired, but by my experience that is not true, you have to pass by all 4 to get offer. The key is practice of coding problems consistently, from easy to hard, in short timing and good efficiency which make you competitive.",

They asked typical technical design and algorithms questions, and also wanted to spend a lot of time hearing me talk about a project I had worked on in the past. The first interview was very straightforward, but they become progressively more difficult. In later interviews they specifically ask you about topics that your resume indicates you have no experience with, to see how you handle unknown situations.Results were given on the spot by HR, so less than 5 days after first getting in touch with Microsoft a job offer was on the table. Overall an extremely efficient interview process. They are clearly pushing to hire early before top grads get snapped up by their competitors.",

        "details": "My first interview was a 30 minute on-campus screen: one puzzle question and a few short, general CS questions. If you know anything at all, this is a piece of cake. The remainder of this review describes my on-site experience.Regarding travel arrangements: I experienced a flight cancellation for my return journey, but the travel team was very supportive and helpful, extending my hotel stay and rebooking my flight.Regarding the interviews:\u2026\u00a0 most of the advice and information available here and elsewhere online is quite accurate (just note that they generally do NOT ask \u201cmount Fuji\u201d questions anymore), and as there is a lot of it (if you are unable or too lazy to find it you certainly do not deserve an offer from any company) I will only give a brief outline of my experience.I arrived at the recruiting building in my rental car and managed to find a single open parking spot. After checking in at the desk, I had about 15 minutes to hang out in the lobby area with around 12 other candidates. They provide free drinks, xbox, and some weird machines running a program called something like \u201ctell us about yourself,\u201d which I tried to use unsuccessfully. The recruiter took me to an office where we spent about 15 minutes going over the day, some interview advice, and a little about my goals and background; nothing technical or difficult.The first 30 minutes of my first \u201creal\u201d interview consisted of discussing his and my background and me asking lots of questions about the product since I had never heard of it. The remaining 30 minutes were filled by a problem on sorting: design, complexity, and pseudocode. He had a somewhat similar background so we had no trouble connecting. Next was my lunch interview at a nearby cafeteria. There was a wide selection of reasonably priced food (though I had a voucher for a free lunch). I decided on a salad for ease of eating. We talked about the company, the team and my goals. Back in his office, I worked out two problems on trees coded up in C++. The next interview was entirely coding; two of the questions were easy but the third gave me trouble; it was the craziest recursion I\u2019ve ever seen. Make sure you practice with trees a lot, and don\u2019t bother much with general graphs. The interviewer gave me lots of tips, and I finished the code at the last minute. The fourth interview was more like the earlier ones; relatively informal conversation in the first half followed by a technical question, in this case design. I had to design a data structure to represent the state of a game. Pretty open ended\u2026 I think the idea is just to have a dialog about design tradeoffs (memory vs. speed and so on). Finally I was happy to make it to the last interview with an upper level person which involved more discussion of the team and my past experiences\u2014no technical questions. Be sure to have something to say about every item on your resume\u2014difficulties you encountered, what you learned, etc. I briefly met the recruiter again and went back to the hotel. In a few days, I heard the good news from the recruiter.So my advice is: 1) ask questions, be curious, and be enthusiastic about the team/product and the company. If you are having a \u201cconversation\u201c and not just a dry Q&A, then you are probably doing this well. 2) spend a few minutes verbalizing your ideas before writing any code. 3) don\u2019t code silently. 4) practice coding on paper or a whiteboard before the interview--preferably with someone watching over your shoulder. It really helps! 5) try to learn something from each interview, anything, then use it in a later interview; ESPECIALLY if the interviewer specifically gives you advice. They want you to succeed. Remember this if you get nervous.This is mostly drawn from advice I\u2019ve heard elsewhere, but I found it to be particularly useful. Good Luck! Also, everyone I encountered at Microsoft was very nice and personable. The interviews felt mostly relaxed and enjoyable.",

        "details": "I made a general submission on Microsoft's career site. About two months later, a Microsoft recruiter contacted me and asked me some general questions about my background. She then directed me to another recruiter who asked me if I would be interested for a position on the MSN team. I said I was interested, and a few days later, she set up a phone interview with the hiring manager.The phone\u2026\u00a0 interview was completely technical. I had to write code in a Live Meeting session. First I was asked to write some very basic HTML and CSS. Then I was asked to code up a problem that was recursive in nature. I struggled a little bit, but was able to come up with a solution in the end.A few days later, my recruiter told me that Microsoft wanted to fly me to Seattle for an on-site interview. A week later, I flew out for a day of interviewing. My interview consisted of three one-hour interviews, and one 1.5-hour interview that included lunch.My first interviewer had me code up a pretty standard problem on the whiteboard. As I coded it up, she asked me questions about what I was doing and how efficient my code was. My final code was not very efficient, but that turned out to be okay as she was just looking to see how I think. She also asked me to describe a time where I solved a hard coding problem on my own.My second interviewer had me design the classes that would be required for a CSS parser that would ultimately try to compress a CSS file by merging redundant selectors. Most of my time was spent designing the basic data structures and explaining how I would go about merging selectors. Again, he was just looking to see how I think.My third interview consisted of a one-hour lunch followed by a half-hour whiteboard coding session. The lunch portion was pretty casual where we mostly talked about what I've worked on in the past. The coding portion was pretty standard. I struggled a bit, but that turned out to be okay.I was told ahead of time that the fourth interview was contingent on how well the first three interviews went. So I was happy when I was told that I would have a fourth interview. The fourth and final interviewer was an old man who was higher up on the ladder. The interview was very laid back. He asked me questions like why I wanted to work at Microsoft, how long I intended to stay, and if I plan to pursue higher education. It was my impression that if you make it to the fourth interview, it's already been decided that you're technically capable of working at Microsoft. Now it was time to see if you had the right personality to work there.Two weeks later, my recruiter called me up with an offer.Overall, very positive experience. Every interviewer was very nice. They all tried to make me feel as comfortable as possible, giving me helpful hints when I started to struggle with a coding problem. They were definitely more interested in how you think than the final code that ends up on the whiteboard. Perfection is not required.",

Started at 8am, and it lasted through dinner (taken out by prospective manager) until about 9pm.

Most were coding questions (boring & don't measure intelligence in my opinion), and there were a few math questions (probability & statistics).I observed that the work environment really depends on the team dynamics. Each group is a little fiefdom that competes with other groups.Of the 2 groups, I had no interest in joining one of them, and was very attracted to the other group. Unfortunately, the group that I wanted to be in deliberated, but decided not to extend an offer. The final process took 2 days.

        "details": "Contacted by a recruiter. Had a preliminary 'skills phone interview' (how long using x technology)...I was honest basically saying 15 years C++, but < 6 on the web and C# front.Was called in for a day interview. I was told I would meet with three people.After my third interview (lunch), I was taken to meet with two other people, then walked to the door.On the surface, the interview was more\u2026\u00a0 or less normal. These guys were experienced software developers who were some nice, some grumpy, some arrogrant, some sociable, some not. Normal.They ask me what I'm working on, some questions about my past, then I ask what they're working on, and then each interviewer asked a technical question, it seemed like because they knew they were supposed to because it's microsoft.The questions were hard, but it wasn't as nitpicky as I feared, and after working through the problems I felt like I came to reasonable solutions. But I didn't get an offer, so maybe they didn't feel the same? Honestly several of these problems I would have answered by classifying the algorithm, looking it up on wikipedia and coding.My last interview with the senior staff member was the worst. He didn't seem very interested in my answers. He asked if I wanted to change any of my answers to previous interviewers, as if somehow their were 'right' and 'wrong' answers, I guess. Sticking to who you are and what you do best is the wrong way? He asks if I have any questions, but then provides non answers to the ones I ask, so I say no, I can't think of any. I asked about work life balance and got the distinct impression that I was way out of bounds.Now that I think about it, I don't feel really good about the experience. Between all the emailing between interviews, the trading info, the puzzles, and the trick questions, it seemed more like trying out for a game show than a job. I believe this guys were reducing me to a zero or one (hire/no hire), and their questions were being taylored to make their decision. It was not about trying to understand who I am and what I could bring to the table. So I answer that I prefer references over pointers and I am a no hire? Immature at best.In that regard, a bad experience. Be prepared to be underestimated, under-respected and not seen. After putting it out there for this kind of experience you will inevitably end up feeling like a fool. Why do they use a process like this? One has to wonder about the experience working there if this is the recruitment setup.One guy intimated that they work pretty crazy hours there, so I suspect a big part of the interview was trying to find someone M$ could own. Not me I guess, though the technology was tempting. I would have tried it, I admit.The recruiter was on time with the no offer news (5 days), the best part about the interview (though I did enjoy talking to a couple of the guys).It worked out, I guess.",

Another interview was scheduled.This interviewer was strongly biased towards SDE/T positions. He asked me why I applied for an SDE position and not SDE/T. I gave my explanation and was told the same could apply to SDET therefore I should really consider SDE/T. I said ok, but I like SDE (matter of personal choice really). After a lot of chatting about stuff like this we finally arrived at the technical questions. I was asked to return the longest palindrome in a given string. I was barely given 5 minutes (because most of the time was spent in explaining why SDET is kind of better as SDETs focus on code quality rather than just shipping a product). Further few minutes were given to test the code that I wrote.Btw, did I mention that I was supposed to write code in live meeting where there is no way you can edit the text you've typed? No indentation, nothing? (I couldn't figure it out, neither could my interviewer) After this, it took them over a month to reject me. The interviewer said 1-2 weeks.I was expecting so much from this.

I left completely demoralized.The interviewers were certainly nice, and Microsoft does a great job of making sure that you are comfortable. They paid for the flight, lodging, food, rental car, etc.When I arrived, I spoke w/ an HR representative who seemed distant and unengaged with our conversation.My second interview was odd in the sense that the discussion focused\u2026\u00a0 entirely on arcane aspects of SQL and some generic problem solving. That was fine, but then he posed a string interpolation problem on the whiteboard and asked me to write an algorithm...I am a-ok with problem solving, but I am one of the cerebral 'think it out' type of developers. Tossing ideas on a whiteboard isn't how I do things.... and I think the interviewer picked up on this. Ultimately, I came close to solving it, but I was feeling a bit pressured and out of my comfort zone.The third interview was with a very, very senior SDE who proceeded to grill me on c/c++, memory allocation, stack frames, register allocation, etc. While my resume reflected some commercial c/c++ experience, that was over 10 years ago.... since then I have focused almost entirely on java/.net and other languages. More importantly, the position I was interviewing for didn't require any c/c++ experience.The interviewer then chose to present a problem which involved the development of a 'move' algorithm for cribbage. This was another 'whiteboard' problem where given enough time, I could have solved it, but they really, really put the screws to you... and expect you to think on your feet... quickly.The last interview was a 'fluff' interview during lunch, and I could tell that the interviewer was just passing time. Another whiteboard problem followed where I had to develop a base-26 version of itoa(), which was simple enough.... but I messed up on a bit of syntax...The bottom line is that while I was certainly capable of solving any of the problems, the medium/platform they expect you to solve them is totally incompatible with my personal comfort zone.Am I smart enough to work at MS? Absolutely...I have over 20 years of industry experience using a variety of microsoft tools and platforms. I also have a proven track record of architecting, developing and delivering secure, high-volume websites and enterprise systems. This is no BS... I can do the job.However, there is a definite culture clash between MS and I.I have been told that other dev groups at MS are similar with their approach and style... which is why I will not be interviewing there anytime soon :)",

Instead, I went straight to Redmond along with my other team members for on-site interview. It started from 9 to 5, full day including lunches. Each interviewer had me for an hour, and asking me coding questions, design questions, my past experience\u2026\u00a0 (especially how well I know the project that was being bought into Microsoft), and the usual. At the end of the interview I was taken to a person who said if I wasn't hired I wouldn't have met him, so I was very happy. A few days later I got an offer that is pretty decent, and so I took the job.",

        "details": "msft has two rounds. 1st round is usually on-campus. Recruiters usually come to campus multiple times throughout the year. It's always not a big deal if you miss once - because they'll always come back again in a month or so.1st round is half an hour. Usually 5 min behavioral and the rest is tech. Depends on how fast you are and the actual recruiter, the number of questions being\u2026\u00a0 asked could range from 1 to 5.It takes about 1-3 weeks to hear from the recruiter about the result of the 1st round. Then they'll schedule an on-site interview with you. Usually you can choose four dates in the next coming month and they'll finalize one. They'll fly you to seattle (or other location you chose) and take care of all expense (hotel, transporation, meals etc).The on-site interview takes one-full day from around 8:15am to roughly 4pm. The actual length varies depends on your performance. Usually you'll be interviewing with two groups, one in the morning and one in the afternoon and there's a lunch interview in between. You'll meet 2-3 interviewers from each group. If you really screw up your morning interview there could be a chance that your afternoon interviews will be cancelled (they'll tell you your next interviewer is sick or something). You'll get an offer from the group only if all interviewers say yes and if one or more says no you won't get one. So that means you still have two chances (two groups).Each interview is 1on1 (95% of the time taking place in the interviewer's office) and takes about 1 hour. The interview consists of short behaviral questions and majority is about tech questions. You will be writing code on whiteboard. At the end of each interview, the interviewer will bring you to your next interviewer. They will exchange about questions already asked to you and your performance. If you make your way to see the dev manager in the end - the last interviewer, that means you are doing a decent job. If you don't even get to see the manager that means 99% likely you are already out.In the past it usually takes about 1 week after your on-site interview to hear about the result (could be longer if you don't get an offer). But now they expedite that to immediate result - you'll be asked to return to building 19 (it was optional in the past). And if your recruiter wants to see you that means you'll be hearing about an offer. And if you are told you can leave and wait for result, that possibly indicates a negative answer.Now they are experimenting new interview process which is more similar to Cisco's, which consists of 4 interviews which only take half a day, plus some site-seeing and presentations.The compensation is 80k (Software Development Engineer @ 89) base plus up to 20% bonus (realistically, less than 10%) plus stock options. Standard benefits - 401k, free insurance (health, dental, vision), ESPP and other misc stuff. It's lower b/c cost of living is a lot cheaper than bay area and the tax is a lot lower too. Relocation is 5k.You have 2 weeks to accept or decline the offer.",

Finally he asked me how to test the code (basically wanted different test-cases to cover the whole code and its boundary cases).Interview Round 2:1) In an image clouds are scattered all over. Lets say clouds are of white color and the rest of the image has different color. The problem was to count the number of such clouds. (Assume the image is given in a 2D matrix format).2)Given an array find all the sub-arrays that has sum zero. (Note: an nlogn solution is required). A continuation of the above question was to find all subarrays with sum less than a small number lets say 1.Interview Round 3:In this round I was asked about my projects, BTP, interests and had to answer questions like \u2013 \u201cwhy microsoft\u201d or \u201cwhat do you like about it\u201d etc. After that he asked few aptitude-type questions, like-1)Given two dice how would you represent all the days of a month?2)How would you design an automated traffic-signal system?3)What are the measures that you would devise to allow credit cards for children?",

They set me up for an interview in-campus.The interview consisted of asking me about personal and school projects, and any prior experience that may show passion for technology.\u2026\u00a0 Two technical questions were asked (receive two strings and print unique characters in order, implement atoi). At the end the interviewer told me to wait up to 3 weeks.I got contacted about a week later, setting up details for an interview at Mexico City. They told me I would be interviewing with 3 to 4 persons. The interview was about a month later.Microsoft paid for my travel expenses to Mexico City. There, I had 3 interviews, each with a different team. I was told I would not be interviewing for a particular team or position, but being interviewed by different teams gave them a good insight. Each interview is about 45-50 minutes1. The first interviewer gave a few minutes to ask about previous projects. He told me he was in the Embedded Windows team. He then asked 2 technical questions (telephone keypad and angle between minute and hour hand in a clock), and a brain teaser. He seemed interested in knowing my thinking process, rather than the actual solution.2. The second interviewer first focused more on behavioral questions and some past experience. He told me he was in the Operating Systems group, focused in security. He seemed as if it was an interview recipe for him, as he would not allow to talk about anything else.The questions were the next:- What has been the most challenging technical issue you have faced?- Tell me about a Microsoft product you like. Why? How has it been useful to you?- Tell me about a Microsoft product you don't like. Why? What would you have done differently, if you were part of the dev team for that product?Then he asked two technical questions (show odd numbers from 1 to N, function that swaps variables).This interviewer did not allow any question during the technical question. He was definitely not interested and what I thought while solving the problem, and did not want other solutions but his. H3. My third interview was the longest, as we had a long conversation. He was in the Windows Update team, in charge of reviewing and fixing upon feedback provided, and deployment. He first asked my most challenging technical issue, as my answer was similar to the first one he asked me about another one. Interviewers share notes between them, so they don't ask you the same stuff. He also asked me what had I accomplished at my job that I was proud of. After some chit-chat on SQL and databases, he asked a technical question (Fibonacci with index).",

Being from the eastern side of the US, this was quite late for me and I was very sleepy by the end of it. We were told we would be given lunch before our interviews, but no lunch was given leaving those of us who had not eaten fairly hungry. I also found out I was being interviewed for the wrong position due to a clerical error.All of my interviewers (there were 4) except for one were rushed and had little to no time for questions from me at all. They had been doing interviews all day and did not really seem to care or want to speak with me about anything but their technical questions so that they could move on to the next candidate. Each of the 4 interviews consisted of a few questions about previous projects followed by a technical question that took almost the whole interview time-slot to implement before I was tossed off to another interviewer.Due to jet lag and the late interview times, my later interviews did not go too well and I was quite burned out by the end of it. They had a fun lobby with a MS Surface, Guitar Hero and other entertainment, but the people just seemed cold and uncaring compared to other companies with whom I had interviewed in the past.",

They were true to their word about the pizza -- and I gotta say that there was an awful lot of it -- but it turned out that you needed to hand in\u2026\u00a0 your resume if you wanted the Xbox! I had to run to a computer to print one out! Anyway, I didn't expect to get a response (my resume's pretty bad) so imagine my surprise when I got an e-mail from them a few weeks later asking me to come in for an interview!My interview was broken up into two parts -- a discussion about my interests and experience and the \"fun\" part that involved applying my knowledge of algorithms and data structures.The first part involved answering a bunch of questions about me and my interests. It was all the usual things you get in a typical interview, e.g. when did I first become interested in software development, what things have I've worked on... The lady was pretty nice and smiled the whole time so I don't know if my responses were the right ones or not.The skills test was actually easier than I thought it would be. I was ushered into a room with a reasonably friendly guy and he handed me a pen, some paper and a sheet of questions. Over the course of the test, I was told to answer three of them. They were actually things people could've solved given enough time. Unfortunately, it turns out that I don't do well under time pressure and I croaked as a result. When it was over, he thanked me and led me to the door. He said a couple of positive things about me and we went our separate ways.I'm a bit disappointed at myself for messing up. However, it was a good learning experience and I at least got a free Xbox for my troubles.",

We generally started interviewing here and he asked some of my project related questions..No code here.Interview 2:My lunch interview was with this really young chap..we ate..taked generally..After lunch we walked back to his office... BAM! gives a marker pen in my hand... n acts as if he doesnt know me at all.. says How would you implement a program which would return a copy of a linked list given the head pointer of the original linked list.(Im giving away my questions coz i did not sign any NDA!).. talked it out quite a bit..developed logic from scratch, wrote pseudo-code, checked-double checked boundary conditions... got the logic approved.. said there are 2 ways to do it.iterative and recursive.. he asked which would you prefer when and why? I explained takin into consideration space, time, situation where the algo would actually be used and so on...he was happy with it.and then i coded it..done!. then he suggested another variant where every node of the linked list had a random pointer (in addition to the next pointer) which could randomly point to another node or be NULL..how would you duplicate such a linked list???? This was a little tricky...but doable..i got it right..everything went off fine.. he then takes me to the next interviewer.Interview 3:Again a young chap..asked a quick question about a past project. n then went straight to the white board... explaned in 3-4 sentences what BFS is.n then said..given a BST..how would you implement a variant of BFS wherein you print the first node... then the nodes in the next level from right to left.then the nodes in the next level from left to right..n the next from right to left and so on.. he asked me to give him data structures and the algo...quite tricky.neva saw this qs before.got stuck a lil..but he hinted me at very specific points...n i was quick to pick up on it.. i figured it out eventually..it can be done using 2 stacks.. I liked this question..then he says i have 15 mins left.n he throws another problem at me.asks me to strategize and code the following problem... usually in linked lists. whenever you create a node.you dynamically allocate some memory and attach a node..but what if you were given some preallocated amount of memory.. in an array..and each element of your array would have a pointer to a node of a linked list. how would you insert into an linked list in this case???..think about it..interesting question..I solved it.but dint have time to code itInterview 4:Really old chap..very very very experienced.. Principal Development Lead for UI in Windows 7... .he asks me about this one project i did in grad school..its was a computer vision project..i explained it on the white board..n in a way i was glad he asked that question since that was one of ma favourite projects and i did reall well in it...he liked what i said.,.. then he draws this on the board: algorithms--API--User experience.. n talks about how API's kinda join work going on in both ends.. n says there are jobs in all three fields..if given a choice..which would you prefer i said more towards the left side of the line.. n he made a note of it... then we again sat back and started talkin bout a lot of stuff..went of pretty ok.. n finally he asked me a design question.how would you implement a linked list class.. simple question..but im kinda weak in the my class design concepts having working mostly in c... but i took sum help from him and figured it out.. he was ok with it..after a while he said im done.for the day.I get back to my room at the marriott.. heavily retrospecting... i felt i performed brilliantly through the day.. trust me guys..im not being conceited here... i really felt i did well.n i cudin think of a single place where i made a crucial mistake or anythin... i did take help in a couple of occasions.. but im guessing they don hold that against you.. 2 days later my recruiter calls and says that they usually give out rejects by email.but he called me to give the news coz my decision was a tough one to make n it was real close... which i din feel was a consolation at all... i asked him for one.jus one reason/hint wateva..off/on the record...i don care...but he said its company policy not to give out feedback..... was dead disappointed with it.... took me a while to get over it,,...",

Then he asked the complexity of the algorithm, where I stumbled a bit. But he helped me in that and we came up with the answer O(n). After that, I didn't hear from Microsoft in 3-4 weeks.

But I did both of them in 1 hour, compiled and send them the working code.Then they called up for a technical interview asking following questions-How would you test an application that takes 3 inputs and draws a triangle? (black box testing)-Write a data structure class that works as both a Stack and a Queue. Write test cases for them.-Write code to reverse a linked list. Write test cases.-Write code to merge-sort 2 linked lists (no duplicates). Write test cases.-Write code to delete all nodes in a linked list that contain integer values that are odd numbers. Write test cases.-Write code to delete alternate nodes in a doubly linked list. Write test cases.- Given \"ABC/EF\" where do you place values G, H, and I. (pattern matching puzzle).-How will you write a function to merge two sorted arrays assuming one of them have enough space to hold all the members.After this they called me up to MS\u2019s EU headquarters in Ireland, pretty basic interview, back to back 5 interviews, all pretty easy, asking questions about C++ internals, pointers and few simple algorithms, search a list, sort an array, overloading etc.After this (i.e. after about 10 interviews in total and 1 coding test) they precede with an offer the next day, which was sadly only \u20ac30K amazingly a very low offer from such a big company. I discussed with the Microsoft\u2019s HR abut the growth prospects what will be my pay after 1 year and then 2 year, turned out its pretty basic, 36-37K after first year and 40-42K after 2nd. I also applied at Accenture; they offered 42K + benefits straight away. So I can\u2019t believe it, but I had to ditch Microsoft and join Accenture. In the end I felt that Microsoft wasted so much of my time, not worth apply a job here. My advice is if you are smart and can make it, join Google.

Likely it was because I was recommended by other\u2026\u00a0 Microsoft employee (based in US), so they assumed that I am applying for the job in US. When clarified, they passed my CV to Irish recruiters which moved me directly to phone screening. Probably it's the best to get recommended, so you can skip some initial filters.Phone screens were quite typical:- short technical questions covering OOP, programming languages, databases, networks (5-10 mins)- design question (15 mins)- coding question (typically related to the design from previous step - 20 mins)- discussion of coding solution (how to improve it, how to test it, what are the test methodologies - 10 mins)- Q&A (now you can ask questions)On site interview consisted of four 1:1 interviews (45 mins each + 15 min break) with multiple engineers. Some focus on design skills, some on coding (on the whiteboard), some on testing. Everybody asks some short random questions about algorithms, data structures, programming languages, network protocols etc.The last hour (only 2 out of 10 people got there when I was interviewed) was with a director of the department to which I was applying. It was really hard! I was asked about network protocols, data structures, got an algorithmic problem to solve (similar to \"egg dropping problem\"), where I had to figure out the optimal (not any!) algorithm and provide a formal mathematics proof of it's complexity (big O notation).",

When clarified, they passed my CV to Irish recruiters which moved me directly to phone screening. Probably it's the best to get recommended, so you can skip some initial filters.Phone screens were quite typical:- short technical questions covering OOP, programming languages, databases, networks (5-10 mins)- design question (15 mins)- coding question (typically related to the design from previous step - 20 mins)- discussion of coding solution (how to improve it, how to test it, what are the test methodologies - 10 mins)- Q&A (now you can ask questions)On site interview consisted of four 1:1 interviews (45 mins each + 15 min break) with multiple engineers. Some focus on design skills, some on coding (on the whiteboard), some on testing. Everybody asks some short random questions about algorithms, data structures, programming languages, network protocols etc.The last hour (only 2 out of 10 people got there when I was interviewed) was with a director of the department to which I was applying.

        "details": "Typical interview process at Microsoft Ireland is the following:- CV screening / filtering (my guess is that 90% of applications are rejected at this stage)- coding puzzle (solution to be sent in 1 hour)- initial phone screen (HR + simple technical questions)- 1 or 2 technical phone interviews (engineers)- on site interviewSomehow I didn't have to do the first coding puzzle. Likely it was because I was recommended by other\u2026\u00a0 Microsoft employee (based in US), so they assumed that I am applying for the job in US. When clarified, they passed my CV to Irish recruiters which moved me directly to phone screening. Probably it's the best to get recommended, so you can skip some initial filters.Phone screens were quite typical:- short technical questions covering OOP, programming languages, databases, networks (5-10 mins)- design question (15 mins)- coding question (typically related to the design from previous step - 20 mins)- discussion of coding solution (how to improve it, how to test it, what are the test methodologies - 10 mins)- Q&A (now you can ask questions)On site interview consisted of four 1:1 interviews (45 mins each + 15 min break) with multiple engineers. Some focus on design skills, some on coding (on the whiteboard), some on testing. Everybody asks some short random questions about algorithms, data structures, programming languages, network protocols etc.The last hour (only 2 out of 10 people got there when I was interviewed) was with a director of the department to which I was applying. It was really hard! I was asked about network protocols, data structures, got an algorithmic problem to solve (similar to \"egg dropping problem\"), where I had to figure out the optimal (not any!) algorithm and provide a formal mathematics proof of it's complexity (big O notation).",
