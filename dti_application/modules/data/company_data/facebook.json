        "details": "I attended Facebook's University Day, where they had about 20 university students who were there for interviews. The day starts off with the interview itself, then you spend about 5 hours touring the Facebook campus and learning more about Facebook. When the interview process began, all of us were siting in a room and interviewers would come in and call our names. I watched as interviewer after interviewer came in\u2026\u00a0 with cheerful looks on their faces and called out names of other students. After about 5 minutes, my interviewer came in and called me. He was a heavy set man, dressed sloppy, and had a look on his face like he didn't want to be there. I could tell right away that it would not go well. When we entered the interview room, he immediately began asking technical questions. He didn't ask any questions about me to get to know me, and after asking other students that were there, they all began with a talk about their backgrounds. During the entire interview, I had the impression that my interviewer just wanted to rush me through so he could go on to do something else. He asked me 2 questions, one which went well and a second where I had a bit of trouble. My recruiter had told me beforehand that if we got stuck on a question, our interviewer would make an effort to get us back on track by offering hints. My interviewer did no such thing. I even told him what I was trying to do, and why I was getting stuck, implying that I could use a hint. He just sat there without saying anything. Finally after I wasted about 10 minutes trying different ways to solve it, he tells me that we're running out of time and hurries me through the rest of the problem. He gave me the last 5 minutes to ask him questions. Since I had a feeling that he was being forced to be there, one of my questions was if Facebook employees have dedicated interviewers, or if random employees are selected to be interviewers from time to time. He said it was the latter. So of course I knew that he was being forced to be there and he just wanted it to end. After the interview was over, he walked me back to meet the other students. By this time I already knew he wasn't going to give me a good review, but Facebook doesn't all you to go home at this point. You're forced to spend 5 hours learning about how wonderful it is to work at Facebook so that you know about all the good things you just missed out on. A week later I received my rejection email.",

The recruiters I\u2026\u00a0 worked with, on the other hand, mostly seemed like they had their act together.I thought my interviews went well \u2013\u00a0each of my on-site interviewers complimented me on my solutions, so I was surprised when my recruiter emailed me that I did not get an offer.Something fishy is definitely going on at Facebook. I am under the impression that their HR department is not completely honest with their candidates. If you sort the interviews by date on Glassdoor, you will notice that no one recently has been getting offers. I've been told by friends (inside and outside the company) that they thought Facebook wasn't even hiring anymore until the Fall... So I was definitely surprised when I was approached with the opportunity to interview with Facebook. I am at a loss of words after receiving my rejection despite the positive feedback my interviewers provided me. This experience has definitely deterred me from considering Facebook for future employment as it feels like I was brought through the process just so HR could justify their recruiting budget despite there being no job.",

I scheduled an interview a week after their contact, and ran prep (LeetCode.com offers a lot of questions in the style of their whiteboard tech interview) as much as I could.There were three other candidates in the lobby at the same time as me. I can only assume that there are as many as a couple dozen interviews done daily at this rate (they were scheduled 15 minutes before me).The technical interview is scheduled for a pretty tight (not hard, but they will stop you) 45 minutes. You'll get asked some sort of non-linear algorithmic question, and you MUST FOLLOW THE INTERVIEW PREP INSTRUCTIONS PRECISELY. One of the options for blueprinting out your solution is to maybe toss some pseudocode up explaining your algorithm - I did it a little while trying to explain and got dinged for \"jumped to coding right away.\"As far as I can tell, they go through enough candidates that they can be extremely picky with their technical selection - ace it, you're golden.

He did a quick phone screen and forwarded an overwhelming number of resources to help with the interview process. This included live meetings with Gayle Laakmann McDowell with help on technical interviews. I've never been more prepared by a recruiter and probably never will be again. Ironically, this is one of the cases\u2026\u00a0 where I needed it the least. It really just wasn't as technically challenging as interviews at Google or Microsoft.He then followed up and was super flexible on the phone screen which I opted to do in person. It's on the candidates schedule and terms. Very accommodating. During the in-person initial screen, the recruiter again offered tons of preparation and \"pep talk.\" He did say not to rush and to take my time, which is definitely a tendency of mine. Don't listen to that advice, though. My adherence to this advice was ultimately cited as the reason for my rejection (my slow deliberation was interpreted as \"struggling\"). But otherwise, it was extremely helpful and really great.The interviewer I was scheduled with was out sick so I got another guy. It was the least adversarial interview of the Google/MS/Amazon style I've ever done. He was helpful and supportive. Very laid back (he was wearing sweat pants and a T-shirt) which really helped.I really took my time and avoided going into rush-panic like I do, and was only able to get through one question in the allotted time. I answered it and came up with the solution on my first try (very long and deliberate first try), which even my interviewer said he couldn't do during his interview. But at the end of the day, I was rejected anyway.It showed that it's important not to obsess over the technical preparation. The guy who interviewed me probably was less prepared technically when he interviewed, but he probably did a better job on the soft skills. And he got the job. I worked through on the technical front with no issue, but probably spoke without a sense of confidence and made bad jokes while slowly deliberating through the problem.",

I was called onsite shortly.Onsite I had 5 modules. 3 \"ninja modules\", which are coding based, 1 \"jedi module\" which is behavioral/resume/experience and a small coding problem, and 1 \"pirate module\", which is system design. I've done interviews with Google and LinkedIn as well (and\u2026\u00a0 got offers from both), and the coding problems at Facebook were actually the simplest. I smashed all the coding interviews. The Jedi interview was pretty good too.The place where I failed was the pirate module. If you are interviewing with FB, I cannot stress enough that you really really need to prep system design. I actually failed my design interview spectacularly (they asked me to design a popular feature on FB). But based on my other performances, they decided to call me back the next week for another system design interview. Well, I failed that one too, LOL. Yes, apparently I was that bad at system design.It is strange, because at Google I was specifically told that the system design interview was used to \"slot\" a software engineer only (senior, staff, etc.). i.e. it was not a dealbreaker. For FB, apparently it is a dealbreaker. Personally I think every one has certain strengths and weaknesses. I readily admit that my weakness is system design. My strength is algorithms and coding, and I've actually done pretty well in competitive programming as well. But FB really would prefer to see someone who knows a decent amount about everything, rather than be really good at one thing (algorithms and coding) and not great at another (system design).As far as the interviewers go, they were an amazing bunch. Even when I was bombing the system design module, the interviewer was very respectful, encouraging, and friendly. I walked away with a very positive experience. Everyone was excited to be working there, and I can see that it is a terrific place!If you are interviewing there, my advice is to really read up on many many open source architectures, and thoroughly understand system design. If you clear that module, you will almost certainly get in, the other stuff isn't hard at all.",

Still, interview questions tend to be general enough that, as long as you aren't completely unfamiliar with the language syntax, you can generally do a decent job in any language. So off we went in C++.The interviewer was very pleasant, and even gave me some tips for how to improve my resume at the beginning. Then we dived into the coding. He had actually chosen a great question to determine my programming ability. Unfortunately, I botched it by making too many assumptions about the question and not considering carefully enough what lay behind the interface that the interviewer had provided me.This all happened maybe two or three weeks ago and I am sure that I won't be progressing to the next step. The one negative in all this is that the recruiter has not followed up at all with me. Yes, rejection is not uncommon when applying at a company like Facebook, but that doesn't mean that the company shouldn't have the courtesy to at least inform you of it.So overall, great experience in the beginning but I was turned off by the lack of respect for the process that I sensed from the recruiter.",

Unlike Google (interviewed with them also), Facebook seems to have a smaller question pool as one of the system design questions I got I've also\u2026\u00a0 seen on Glassdoor before.I recommend going through the information recruiters provide for interview preparation. Since Google and Facebook use very similar processes, \"Stevey's Blog Rants: Get that job at Google\" post is also quite relevant and useful. Know your data-structures, algorithms, practice solving problems for a few weeks and you should be in good shape.For system design questions, you will be asked to design Facebook-scale systems. Think data way beyond the scope of one machine, billions of items, thousands of requests per second. Hands on experience with such systems is of course \"the king\". In the absence of that - study distributed NoSQL systems, MapReduce and similar things and you should be in good shape.Overall I was very happy with the on-site interviews and the level of support Facebook recruiters and engineers provided me. This was probably the best interview experience that I've had.Having a competing offer handy will surely help you negotiate better compensation. Facebook seems to have an awesome culture. Deciding to reject their very generous offer for another one wasn't an easy call.

I chose the in-person option, and got an\u2026\u00a0 invite for a round of full day (5 total) within few hours after the initial screen.Facebook recruiters send interview prep materials to the candidates on what to expect, what to brush up on, as well as some suggestions tailored to a particular candidate's weak-ish spots (in my case it was the speed of coding). I knew what to expect going in and felt well prepared on this front.Initial screen was algorithm + coding. Nothing overly challenging.Onsite consisted of 5 interviews (+ informal lunch) covering:1) One \"Jedi\" interview with a hiring manager testing behavior / culture fit + warm-up coding. Prepare to talk about past experience, career goals, as well as several \"tell me about the time when...\" questions.2) One \"Pirate\" interview: System design portion of the interview. There are great resources on Quora on suggestions on how to prepare and what to pay attention too.3) Three \"Ninja\" interviews focusing on algorithm + coding. I actually have seen all of the questions I got asked at Facebook before, but that did not help me as ultimately the reason for rejection was cited as not being able to come up with optimal solutions and code fast enough.Got an phone call from the recruiter in about a week+few days after the interview telling me the unfortunate news. I think I had to wait few extra days because of the July holidays and typically the process is faster.Culture: I did find some of the junior Facebook engineers conducting my interview a bit arrogant and cocky, but nothing too alarming.All in all, I had a positive interview experience.

It really comes down to how much you prepare yourself mentally to code within the context of an interview, and how much you study Career Cups as well as the other resources given to you\u2026\u00a0 by the recruiter. Sadly, you don't have to be a great developer at all.What's interesting is that none of these skills have been necessary during my 17 years of real world experience. I never had to write code on a whiteboard (except for other interviews) and I don't see how \"writing code fast\" should be considered a measurement of someone's productivity and code quality. That sort of thinking seems naive and haphazard to me.What frightens me is that I think Facebook truly believes they're \"raising the bar\" with this system. But they're not always hiring good people, and they're probably turning down a lot of great folks.The coding tests were super easy. Two were questions I've actually asked myself while conducting interviews for another company which was aimed towards entry level developers. I really wish they would have asked more challenging questions. I was able to finish them before the end of each panel, and with optimal solution.The design question they gave me actually aligned with something I developed and designed for a product used by millions. I felt good with how everything went at the end of the day, but somehow I failed at *both* coding and design. Interesting... whatever.Two of my friends--whom of which I mentored at my last company--were able to get offers at Facebook (same office, same interview process) but they were *not* the best coders nor the top performers, so if you get turned down at Facebook, don't take it seriously. They say there is some \"randomness\" in the interview, but it just seems strange that common sense didn't kick anywhere to question the obvious, or just the fact I was interviewed by a few people with only 5 years experience. Smart, but inexperienced (and somewhat arrogant) wanting to judge you with entry level coding questions.Half of the people that interviewed me didn't go through the interview process themselves. They were brought in by acquisitions. Specifically for a product that isn't doing very well right now.I was excited about the idea of working there initially, but after the interview, I wasn't so sure anyway. They do try to put a lot of emphasis on finding great developers, but many of the folks who interviewed me mentioned the codebase was a mess (probably from writing code so quickly and not thinking through it) And their open office (no cubes, no walls, just wires and computers everywhere) is a bit distracting. Not something genuinely appreciated by the people working there who used to have their own office. When you need to focus and get quality work done, there are only so many dedicated rooms to use and they're usually taken.Coupled with the fact that they're Seattle office is located in one of the worst traffic areas, I wasn't so sure I would have accepted anyway.",

I cleared this easily.Facebook's on-site interview process is far more rigorous, though. Each 45-min interview has a clearly defined role, intended to test you from multiple different angles. Specifically, I went through:- 2 \"Ninja\" interviews (coding & algorithms)- 2 \"Pirate\" interviews (system design)- 1\u2026\u00a0 \"Jedi\" interview (behavioral & simple coding)plus lunch with a Facebook engineer.The \"Ninja\" and \"Jedi\" interviews were straightforward. I hadn't seen the coding questions before, but they were not particularly hard. I would rate them as being of just average difficulty, pretty similar to the whiteboard coding questions asked at most other major Silicon Valley tech companies. And the behavioral section of the \"Jedi\" interview was just a friendly chat about my resume and my past experiences.However, the \"Pirate\" interviews were what killed me. Both \"Pirate\" interviews involved being asked to propose and discuss a design for existing features on Facebook. The interviewers were extremely meticulous and questioned me on virtually every last detail of my design decisions. In particular, they focused a lot on how huge datasets should be stored and accessed to support extremely large-scale distributed systems. Even though I am already working on web-scale systems in my current job, I was nonetheless still way under-prepared for this level of technical challenge and scrutiny.My advice to all prospective candidates is to spend most of your time preparing for the \"Pirate\" interviews. The coding questions aren't hard, but the system design questions will likely stretch you to your limit! (Unless you're a fresh grad--they don't ask \"Pirate\" questions to fresh grads. Lucky folks!)Additional side note: interestingly, my Facebook recruiter actually gave me detailed post-mortem feedback on each and every one of my interviews. They are the only major Silicon Valley company I know that does this, so major kudos to them for being so considerate.",

They were very flexible in scheduling both the phone screen and onsite.The phone screen was a standard technical phone screen, with the difficulty dialed up slightly. The solutions allowed were constrained (typically,\u2026\u00a0 constant space). After I presented my solution, we discussed its complexity.The on site was very similar. The interview was very CS heavy. The questions asked relied on the knowledge of the properties of many data structures, including ones that are less often used. I can't recall any technical trivia questions being asked; all the questions surrounded a problem with an implementation that had to be coded on the white board. Parallelism and threads were also covered. I gave my answers in Python, and except for one interviewer that asked for a solution using Java, all accommodated. There was one design and architecture review which as different and a lot of fun. I was asked to design a system for a current feature of Facebook. The interviewers were great to interact with.I had a couple offers that were exploding, and they said they would be able to get a decision back quick. But there was an offsite, so the decision was delayed a few days. I withdrew when I accepted another offer. To put it in context, my other offers were exploding within 72 hours of the on site, so it was a tall order and it's to their credit that they tried.I left very impressed. When I'm looking for a position in the future, I'll definitely check them out.",

He gave me a problem related to BST. Obviously I need to draw the tree etc and\u2026\u00a0 he cannot see that on phone interview. I started with multiple approaches and he told specifically what I need to do eg. give only recursive solution, you can only store few things no extra space. In the end i was able to solve with a minor hint and he was also telling me to fix bugs as I was coding as well indent code as per his standards. Overall it was a good experience but I did not get the offer as they are looking for people who can code in like 10 mins as I was able to code in 15-20 mins. They want bug free code and will only go forward with the best candidate. I think even if you do a minor mistake you are out as there is someone else who will solve it perfectly so try to solve it perfectly :)Another important lesson is if you get option of phone v/s in person interview, I will say go for in person interview as it gives the interviewer the chance to see what you are doing on paper verses imagining that over phone.",

The first one was pretty straight forward, but I spent a long time explaining my thought process and debugging and everything. (As a ton of sites say you do). Second one was a bit more of a puzzle question and stumbled a little on it, basically it was a binary search algorithm. Unfortunately a miscommunication at the beginning of the question caused me to try to think of it in a different direction, but eventually got it and realized time was up so I quickly coded the solution and debugged it, but didn't explain myself probably because I knew the time was up.Ultimately got both questions right with a minor stumble and then was not asked for a further interview, so I really have no idea why, and unfortunately I understand for legal ramifications why they can't tell me.

I was expected to know the solution and code it in 10 minutes which pretty much negated the problem solving aspect of it.The 2 coding round questions were pretty standard. However, one of the questions was a text book question and I stated that I knew the solution to that question following which the question asked was way too tough to be solved in 25 minutes on the white board.Similarly the design interview involved a lot of math and was more difficult than coming up with an architecture . This had been informed prior to the interview though.Overall : The interview experience was mixed probably because most of the questions seemed to be the type of questions that one would/ wouldn't know. There was very little problem solving aspect to the whole process and sadly that is pretty much the case with some interviews for tech companies",

However, I was able to code most of the solution and interviewer seemed happy. He himself told me that.Interviewer was pretty nice.

I had four approximately hour long interviews with a shorter lunch interview part of the way through. Although the interviews were themed (e.g., \"pirate\", \"ninja\", etc.), all were very focused on coding except for one which focused on architecting a system.Several of the coding questions required figuring out the trick underlying the problem in order to get a good solution quickly. Many other companies have stopped asking these kinds of questions since they've found they are not very good at identifying the best people to hire. I felt like I reached satisfactory solutions for each of the questions, but based on feedback I received from the recruiter afterward it was clear they would have preferred me to have been faster.Everybody I interviewed with was friendly and fairly organized, but the sole emphasis on coding and problem solving questions turned me off to the interview process. While it's important to suss out a candidate's technical abilities, these questions don't do a very good job of that. Moreover, they completely ignore other qualities a senior engineer needs to succeed such as cultural fit, leadership abilities, ability to motivate/influence others, having vision, etc. Overall it felt like the process was overly tailored towards entry level college hires instead of mid-career professionals with existing experience.I did not get an offer, but would not have accepted anyways.",

Going and visiting Facebook HQ was great and as the reviews say all the people were great. Recommend doing for the experience. Getting an offer is tough. For me it came down to not being quick enough in answering the questions in the onsite technical interviews. They weren't overly difficult but they want you to move fast, and I tended to take my time and discuss with the interviewers which I believe worked against me.

Two programming questions one on link list and other on BST. For each involved finding the solution (easy to optimal) and then write code optimal solution.

Again I prepared lot on data structures, algorithms and related problem solving. And boom..that was my mistake.

However, the frustrating part for me was that for the given question, there were a few different ways to solve it.From my perspective, it seemed that the approach I used to solve the question was not what the interviewer had in mind. I understand that you\u2026\u00a0 should listen to an interviewer when they interrupt you or give you hints, but to me it seemed like the \"hints\" were basically from the perspective of \"you're not solving this the way I would solve it, even though both of our solutions are O(n)\".The result was that I was basically having to write out a problem on a white board and constantly have my train of thought interrupted. The interruptions were unnecessary, and I had to clarify to the interviewer that my intent would indeed work. Example interruption:Interviewer: \"That array index is giving you the same result as the other value\"Me: \"No, that's a different variable name\"Interviewer: \"Oh, oops. Continue\"orInterviewer: \"Wait, why are you replacing the for loop with a while loop?\"Me: \"Because I want to be able to manipulate the cursor directly\"Interviewer: \"Oh, ok. Continue\"In the above statement, it's clear that the usual method of solving the problem did not involve a while loop (but it could be done to solve the problem). After my solution, the interviewer explained the most straightforward solution to the problem which basically leveraged the constraints of the problem itself, and after seeing that then of course the problem was trivial to implement.So to me, it seemed like the question was more of a riddle than a coding exercise, which I believe to be a bad interview question, and at my current company it's accepted as the WORST type of interview question.It was rather embarrassing for me to be turned down, especially on just the initial screen, but another qualm I had was that screens are generally meant to filter out candidates that can't code at all, not candidates who are questionable in their skills (from my perspective my skills aren't questionable, but clearly I did not give my best performance in this screen).To me it felt as though the interviewer in this case did not have much experience. While I was answering the questions that were given to me, I was having to explain a few quirks to the python language that the interviewer clearly did not know i.e. \"Oh, I didn't know you could compare dictionaries like that\". For that to be said, I can only infer that the ONLY thing this interviewer was looking for is if I answer the question that was given to me in the exact way they wanted it solved.",

        "questions": [
            "Before I get to the question I just want to say that the interviewer had a very thick accent (I'm an international candidate, BTW), and that made it really difficult for me to understand what he wanted me to do. This isn't me being bitter. I'm saying this so that I present a very honest opinion about my interview.That being said, the question wasn't something that can be found online\u2026\u00a0 or in most books, I was given 2 functions String recv() and String ReadLine() [ both these DO NOT take arguments]. recv() generates some string (Example:\"123\\n45\\n6789\"). ReadLine() should read the string being returned by recv() and print all characters until the first \\n. After that it should read the recv() string again and print the next characters until the 2nd \\n.Example: recv(): \"123\\n45\\n6789\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ReadLine(): \"123\" //first call of ReadLine\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ReadLine(): \"45\" // second call of ReadLineHowever, the next sequence now doesn't have a \\n. So, once the end of the string is hit, the ReadLine() function must call recv() again, and append all characters until it reads a \\n.Continuing the above example: ReadLine():6789abcde //Third call of ReadLine\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0recv():\"abc\"// still no \\n...so you must call recv() again\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0recv():\"de\\n\"The commented sections are my explanations (the interviewer didn't give any such things).

He then extended the question but cut me off because we ran out of time (this was completely his fault since he showed up a good 15 minutes late).They proceeded to give me a tour of the campus and talk with current engineers. It would have been fun if it hadn't been for the bad interview. Overall, I got the feeling that they're a large company and are definitely not as agile as they were a couple of years ago.

        "details": "This was for a position in their Infrastructure team in Cambridge MA.Recruiter contacted me in September and was very interested in my background and experience with highly scalable systems - both in Finance and Mobile phone payments.I attended some small intimate presentations they did as they were initially opening a new Boston office and wanted to grow it out. The meetings were great and I learned a lot about how\u2026\u00a0 they solve some of their biggest problems.I then did a screening interview on-site (because I don't do technical screens well on the phone). The question was \"Given a binary tree, write code to print the tree out line by line\". I did OK and got the Breadth First Search down fine, but couldn't figure out the - line-by-line part. (Turns out this is Facebook's #1 question to ask in interviews).Although my performance wasn't great they gave me a break on that and asked me back for another screening interview. This time I prepared well for another coding interview but it turned out to be a Design interview. The problem was\"Imagine you have 10,000 servers and need to monitor the performance of each one, how would you do it\" - naturally you need to be able to NOT take too much of the bandwidth and so you'll have to do sampling, have some history to watch for trends etc.I passed that and was very excited to be flown out to Menlo Park for the final round.I studied like CRAZY based on questions on this site and CareerCup. I took 4 weeks and studied about 15 hours per week.Turns out I focused on the wrong questions - I studied Tree, String, Array and List algorithms based on the distribution of Q&A but I was asked Binary math and heap algorithms. Here are the questions I was asked.1) How would you implement division without +, - or multiplication (a \"classic\" question, but not one of the ones I would focus on). I bombed on this as I was not expecting and could not recall my binary math. I figured out the high level outline but that was all. That I was asked this in the \"culture fit\" interview made this doubly unexpected.2) Given 10,000 servers containing a Billion integers each how would you find how to find the median? I knew the answer to this question (use two heaps) - not because I had focused on it, but I had found it an interesting question while studying. However he then asked \"How much memory do you need?\" and I didn't know how big the heaps would need to be. The real answer I was trying to get is - what is the minimum heap you need. I had a guess but I think I got this wrong.3) Given a List structure where each node contains a Next node and optionally a pointer to another list, flatten that liste.g.L1 --> L2 --> L3 --> L7 --> L8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0L4 --> L5-->L6WIll be flattened toL1 --> L2 --> L3 -->L4 -->L5-->L6-->L7-->L8I did OK on this - getting the answer - but it appeared I took too long. The interviewer also interrupted me a lot while I was writing an initial solution and that threw me off - I like to be more iterative in my problem solving but I think he expected 100% immediate correctness.He had an observer there too and that guy looked bored out of his mind and that bugged me a little too as it wasn't clear who would be doing the judging.4) I was also handed some hard to read Python code (I don't know Python) and asked to figure out what it does. I did OK on this - but again surprised to be handed hard-to-read code in a language I didn't know.5) One final question \"How would you implement the \"ls\" Unix function in your language of choice. It should take the input:>ls a/b/c/*/e/*/f/*/*/gand the output should be similar the the output given by unix.\"I used a tree structure to represent the file directory structure and wrote a solution from there. I did OK on this.Overall: Everyone seemed very nice - I had a nice lunch and the campus is interesting but it was clear that what I studied was not what I needed to (so lesson learned: don't just trust the distribution of questions on Glassdoor or CareerCup). I even got to walk past Zuckerberg's office (more of a conference room) and saw Sheryl Sandberg in there.One interesting thing I learned is a lot of Google people are leaving for Facebook. Also I'd say if you are over 30 (I am 41) you are a rare bird at Facebook :-)I knew based on the reactions of the interviewers that it was very probably a bust, but overall a good experience and something I will learn from. Very disappointing as I really wanted to be one of the first few Facebook engineers in the Boston area - and to work on their super high scalability issues but such is Life.",

So tip: use whiteboard better, apparently working and clean code is not enough it needs to look clean on board as well :) Overall process was positive. But, I had a feeling that some interviewers are really un-experienced and focus on wrong things. Also big difference from other companies: they expect you to be really fast (read - you need to know answer upfront). If you don't know answer upfront, but come up with solution after thinking, trying, making misatkes and optimizing - it doesn't count, at least it didn't in my case. Try to solve my problem below (if you don't know answer already), implement, test it on board in 15-20 minutes.Advice for FB: train your interviewers to focus on skills, NOT memorized skills.I have offer from big companies/competitors, so I will just go with them.",

I thought \"what the heck, it's a great company\" and got back to her the next day, but she was leaving for the XMas break. No more communication until early Jan. Connecting on the phone was a pain, as first she didn't call until 15\u2026\u00a0 minutes after she said she would. I had stopped standing by the phone and went to email her when she did call, so missed it. We emailed and set something up for an hour later. This time she called 30 minutes late. No apologies or anything. Sigh. She advised that I put all of my other interviews before the Facebook one so that I could get practice, and then signed me up for a free interview review course they run. I went and things were all great, so I told them I was ready. Queue another 2 week pause while they tried to answer a question I had asked before scheduling me. When I finally made it onsite for an interview (mid-late feb), I had expected it to be a full day of interviewing, but instead it was a 30 minute screen before I could do the *actual* interview. In all fairness, I should have seen that coming. But anyways, did the screen and got a response before I had even left the parking that they wanted to schedule my full interview. I also got a call from my recruiter that afternoon to give me interview feedback. I thought that was awesome, as most people don't do that. I can't say how useful it was as I had no negative feedback from my interviewers and her advice was just \"wow, keep doing whatever you just did!\" but it sounds like it could be useful if things don't go perfectly the first time around. Anywho, by this time I had multiple other offers with deadlines on them. I went ahead and scheduled the final round interview for the following week, but ended up canceling the day before as I had decided to go with another company. This seemed to irk my recruiter, despite the fact that she was the one who told me to interview with other companies first and I had been upfront about that and the associated timelines during the whole process. When initial contact and end offer are 2.5 months apart, you can't expect someone to be sitting idle that whole time...The only reason I still rank this as a positive experience is because I had a secondary recruiter I worked with coordinating onsite logistics (the girl who first contacted me was out of state) and he was awesome. If any of you get the chance, work with Charlie. He's direct and super straight forward and knows that candidates are people with multiple options and treats you as such. I do a lot of mentoring and will certainly be sending any of my mentees who expresses interest in Fbook Charlie's way; he's a real gem.",

They definitely have a preference for code questions that combine data structures and creative thinking.

I did apply to a few different roles on their site so I wasn't sure what was up.Turns out first phone call was with hiring manager and I was getting interviewed for a software engineer position. Hiring manager asked if I was told what positions were available and I said no and he was glad to explain for me. I told the manager I was hoping for a security engineering job, not software engineering. He told me I might be a better fit for a different team and he will tell the other manager I was interested and I will hear from him. I asked if there was a opening on that team and he said they are always hiring new talent. I took that as a good sign. I didn't actually get asked to code during the phone interview. I followed up with the recruiters asking where to proceed and whether I could interview with the manager on the other team and they said they will get back to me.I waited and got no emails setting up another interview. I asked what's going on and have not heard back. It's been 10 days. I guess I have been dropped?I am disappointed at the lack of communication and lack of detail from the recruiters.

Still, I got called back the next week for a full day.Lunch, more coding, culture interviews etc... Coding and design were knockouts again, the softer skills were less successful. I think the key here is that you need to present a confident, well rehearsed personality with answers for the usual questions (biggest mistake etc...). DO NOT talk about mistakes and then admit you don't know the root cause for them, even if they were true mysteries.

The on-site consisted of four\u2026\u00a0 interviews, 3 pure coding (of which one is about design) and 1 research interview (I guess this is for all PhD applicants). I was quite happy with the coding ones but the research one was, well, a little annoying since the interviewer seemed to be dismissive to everything. But overall, it was a nice experience, two interviews plus lunch + tour around plus two in the afternoon, and it was done!I did wait for 3 weeks till the decision was make, and during the period the HR seems to be a little nonresponsive. When I followed up what I received was something like a one line email saying \"we are reviewing your case and will come back to you soon\". This was a little annoying especially the feeling of being silently rejected started to grow, but I guess it is not the HR's fault anyway.In the end I was offered a job with flexible titles - software engineer or research scientist or whatever.

One was behavioral, and 2 were technical.In a behavioral interview, interviewer will look at your resume and ask you couple of questions related to it, so make sure you are able to talk about whatever you put on your resume.Two technical interview is mainly coding on a whiteboard. They will ask some basic question like \"why did you choose Facebook\" at the very beginning, but the majority of your time there will be spent coding on a whiteboard.After the interviews, candidates are taken to a lunch on one of the cafeteria on their campus. I really loved the food there, and they have lot of different choices (Italian, Chinese, grills, ...).After lunch there was 45-minute tour around the Facebook campus.The event concluded with two tech talks (one backend and one frontend) and Q&A sessionOverall it was a great experience.",

She was nice enough to provide some interview tips, so I had chance to review some topics. I think fb recruiters are totally on your side.The phone interviewer was a very nice guy, he was definitely not a\u2026\u00a0 recent graduate like some other poster complained, he talked about the pre-internet boom days, so I think he has least 15 years experience.The phone screen took 45 mins.First 10-15 mins, he asked about my background and why it's a good match for the position, why I want to work in FB.Then I was asked to coding question to \"find minimum depth of a binary search tree\". It was not a hard question, any average coder could do it within 15 mins.I wrote the code with no hint or help from him. During the coding, he was mostly quite, at one point, he pointed out a possible bug which I fixed instantly. At the end, I was trying to optimize the code, he said the code would work, no need to optimize it further. Then he let me ask questions about FB about 15 mins.After the interview, I compiled the code and it really worked, didn't even have a single compile error.Next day, I received a rejection letter from the recruiter with no details.So trick is, writing the code is not enough, but your code must be very close the most optimized version known and you should be able to write 'close to perfect' code in minimum time.I googled for similar algorithms and found out my solution was well above the average, but not the best one. I guess they expect you to write something very close to best available code possible can be written, so they single out best coders.So 'move fast, break things'..",

        "details": "First I had a phone interview. The question was fairly straight-forward (multiply two very large numbers given as Strings) and the interviewer wasn't looking for any tricks or anything like that to solve. Like others have mentioned, quick clean code seems to be the key. Unfortunately, the interviewer had a very thick East Asian accent and talking over the phone just made things worse. I had to ask him to\u2026\u00a0 repeat quite a few times. It was probably me but at times I couldn't even tell when he'd asked a question because of the inflection! It must've gone well enough though because I got an on-site call.The on-site was two interviews of 45 min each. In the first one, I took a bit of a hit because a) I couldn't see the solution right away b) it took me a while to get up to speed and code the thing - I did manage to finish it though and it seemed (relatively) bug-free. Again, as lots of people have mentioned, the interviewer seemed quite young, just a year or so out of school and he didn't offer much in terms of feedback - positive or negative - as the interview progressed. Once he'd given me the question and given me the hint that got me started, he was busy with his iPhone, rarely looking up. That kinda sucked.The second interviewer was much nicer - probably one of the best ones I've interviewed with - lots of feedback, lots of encouragement, was accepting of different trains of thought and non-standard answers. Seemed like a really nice guy too.Overall, it seems to be the case with Facebook thata) Your interview really depends on who you getb) They seem to value quick-clean-bug free-optimized code at the first try more than anything elsec) Questions are of average to above-average difficulty (if you've prepared!)",

Not even the question itself but the whole experience, you feel bad if you make a typo (and i did many silly typos that I usually do not make when writing code), because she can see your typing in real time. Also, you cannot debug or anything.. In the end, to understand my idea of a solution, she gave me an example input and asked to traverse it using my code. After getting an idea she said, ok, almost correct, you could find a bug in 10 mins, ya, but we gotta end now.Next day the original recruiter emailed me saying that they wouldn't take me.

I'll admit to having somewhat of an off-day at the on-site. I completely fumbled the \"are there any bugs in your code\" question with at least one of the interviewers; I said there wasn't, but there was a pretty obvious bug once he described the failure mode to me.There was a scheduling mix-up with at least one of my interviewers, which caused my time with him to be cut short. I'm sure that didn't help with him getting a good feel for me for the sake of his interview feedback.The culture seems a bit more corporatey than the recruiting buzz might put forward; it seems geared toward people who want to have one foot in the startup pond while having the other firmly planted on the dry land of large, relatively safe organization. There are a lot of small teams, and the reflection I got is that there is a non-negligible amount of bureaucracy weighing on the organization. I guess when you get to 1000 people, that will happen.The office space is a mostly open floor plan, and the gear the developers are provided to work on is really good stuff.But that's an initial impression, and things are not always as they appear.So yeah, weirdness in the interview scheduling and such dragged down my impression, but I'd probably give the dice another roll if the chance comes up again.

In my push to prepare for what I was expecting to be a technical interview, I somehow neglected to actually figure out what specifically I could work on at Facebook. I mentioned doing something with the large data sets they work on, since my research focused somewhat loosely on large-scale data analysis. Should have prepped for that one, but no problem.

The phone interview was about 20 minutes long and consisted of 2 questions which were algorithmic in nature, one of which was reversing a linked list. I heard back from them about a week later and we setup a time\u2026\u00a0 for an on-site interview. I was alotted $1000USD for travel expenses to travel from Toronto, ON to Palo Alto, CA. The on-site interview lasted 4 hours and was split up into 1 hour interviews with a different engineer. The questions were mostly abstract, and language independent. Content of the questions varied from riddles to database design. My impression of the first three engineers was good, they seemed like nice guys, and knowledgeable. The last interviewer came off as pretentious, I felt as though he wanted me to fail -- just my opinion!Overall, the office culture seemed relaxed and the problems they are solving there are interesting ones. I'd recommend interviewing with them if only for the chance to visit Palo Alto!",

        "details": "Here's my opinion from my experience interviewing at Facebook.They tell you the process in advance. One phone interview, 5 in house interviews (3 coding, 1 design and 1 behavioural). All interviews are 45 minutes each and one-on-one, and you have to write code in all of the coding interviews, and possibly in the design one too. In the first round, one person decides whether you get through or not. In\u2026\u00a0 the 5 rounds, each interviewer provides their feedback after you have finished the interviews which means that if you do badly in one then the other interviewers won't actually know.Be fully aware, and make no mistake about this - there is an incredibly high possibility that you will get rejected. That sounds harsh but consider it from their position - huge numbers of people apply, huge numbers get interviewed, and they have to pick people out somehow. They also say that they prefer to avoid hiring the wrong person so ultimately they end up inadvertantly rejecting good candidates incase they turn out to be a bad hire, so the risk of getting rejecting is even higher. Basically, this means you are most likely going to be wasting a ridiculous amount of your time and effort. Perhaps because of this, they are incredibly nice and friendly. This really was the nicest and most pleasant interview I have had.Also, once you understand the scenario, it really helps to kill your nerves if you suffer from that. After all, why stress about something you have practically no chance of succeeding in? Negative, true, but the odds are really stacked against you and you would do well to understand that and just be yourself.The questions are not that hard, I found. In fact, I solved the first one so quickly I even surprised myself. You do have to write on the whiteboard, but that of course means that there can not be much code to write since a whiteboard is not that big. Indeed the questions are not that hard really. I felt that they do expect you to talk about what you are doing but also to get it right very quickly and without any mistakes. They want to see how you approach the problem etc., but get real - they don't want to see you fumbling around, they want to see that you know the answer and can bang it out.Ultimately, even if you know the answer to the technical questions and you get them right you will still likely fail over something you can't really control or even know about. In my case, they said I didn't have management experience, but you know what, I didn't apply for a manager role and they never even asked about management or leadership at all. I was pretty annoyed to be honest, it felt like a complete waste of my time and I felt like an idiot for worrying so much about the interviews.They do provide you with some preparation links which are useful. There is also a book called Cracking The Coding Interview. It doesn't have their questions in it of course, but it gives you plenty of examples on how to solve these kinds of questions so if you read up on it you should be able to bang them out quite easily.Overall, it is worth going just to see if you can handle it because you probably can! Just make sure that you feel good about what you achieved even if they say no.",

They want to see that you arrive at the decision to use a tree/hashtable/graph whatever, but then they expect you\u2026\u00a0 to bang out that solution. \u00a0"

You won't get detailed enough feedback to know where you might have tripped up, if anywhere, though. From\u2026\u00a0 their point of view, I think this is understandable, but makes it harder to deal with the rejection; if you had fouled up every session you would feel better than if you basically answered all the questions, with seemingly positive feedback from each interviewer, yet not got an offer...As noted elsewhere, it's probably best to be stoic about the whole thing and accept that they have so many candidates they probably apply a \"benefit of the doubt\" policy that works against in their favour; ie. I would imagine they employ a sort of \"thumb up\", \"thumb down\" policy.They are, however, very pleasant and expect to have a positive experience of the process even if the result is not what you might want yourself.",

        "details": "I competed in a Kaggle competition conducted by Facebook.A few weeks after the competition ended I was contacted by a recruiter and asked a few basic questions via email. About a week after that the recruiter told me I was going to be interviewed. He also included a bunch of URLs to read so I would be familiar with the Facebook interview style.The interview was setup by a coordinator. Two\u2026\u00a0 days later the interview took place over the phone.The interviewer introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself by discussing my favorite project. He said my resume was too extensive to discuss. I worked in Silicon Valley for 5 years and have a significant background in software engineering. There was no discussion of the Kaggle competition.He then presented a puzzle. It involved a grid with the letters X, O, and G. X were walls, O were rooms, and G were guards. I had to create an algorithm that computed the the shortest path to each room from a guard. So if it took a guard 3 steps to reach a room, and another guard 2 steps, then you would only keep the 2. The grid was variable size (N x N).The task was to design the algorithm and then code it up in a shared web page. I had about 35 minutes to complete the puzzle.I wasn't able to get it completed. The next day I thought about it while eating lunch and the best way to solve it became clear. I was definitely on the right track during the interview, but it was simply incomplete.The puzzle itself wasn't amazingly hard. It's just the time constraints. I needed another 20 minutes or so to get it done right.A few days later I was told my background was not what they were looking for. This was a really strange thing to say because my background was never discussed. There is no doubt in my mind that my background is strong enough to work at facebook. As a matter of fact, after seeing the skills of the interviewing engineer (I looked him up on LinkedIn), I feel I'm over qualified.A few observations...This was the first time I've been interviewed by someone with significantly less experience than myself.Your past experience is irrelevant. I could have helped Steve Jobs invent the iphone but if you can't solve the puzzle then you'll be passed over.While I was working on the puzzle the interviewer gave me a \"tip\". It turns out that the tip was incorrect. I'm 100% positive that using an efficient solution is completely incompatible with the tip he gave me. Maybe it was part of the test.If you're good at puzzles and have a solid understand of software development, but not a lot of experience, then you should go apply.My personal impression is that they're looking for younger less experienced people. My interviewer started out as an intern so that seems to be a good alternative if you're still in college.",

I did it successfully.

I don't get the sense they cared at all about experience or what I was or have worked on. After that charade was done, we jumped right to the whiteboard.Two programming questions were asked. The first was an array reordering one that was almost trivially easy but I worked through it cleanly. He seemed quite happy with that. The second was significantly harder than the first, a complex array algorithm. I worked my way through it on the board but my solution was non-ideal in time complexity after analysis. He suggested we rework it. While I was able to and understood the logic, I relied on his feedback a bit much to come to the final solution in the last minutes.Got rejection email the next morning from recruiter.

        "details": "I was contacted by a recruiting agency for software engineering position at Facebook, and after I told them I was willing to apply, my resume was forwarded to Facebook's recruiter. Next day, I got an email from the FB recruiter with a link to an online coding test on interviewstreet. This test was for one hour duration, designed to test coding skills of the interviewer. It was a string parsing\u2026\u00a0 problem and code could be written in any language and we'd just need to submit the output on a given input set. I got an email later from the Facebook people that I passed that test and would need to do a phone interview. My phone interview was scheduled in a week.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An engineer called me up for the phone interview and asked about my work projects. I explained to him briefly and also got to know a little about his work at Facebook. He then followed onto the technical interviewing part and posed a problem for me. We were working on a shared document for this part. This was a problem about the classic binary search tree data structure, like an RB Tree. I coded a simple solution and I was asked to analyse its runtime complexity. I analysed the complexity and was able to put it in Big O notation. He was satisfied with that solution and then moved onto talking about his work, what Facebook is expecting from the candidates and such. The conversation quickly ended after that . A couple weeks later, their recruiter informed me that I passed the phone interview and would be scheduled personal interviews.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About a month after my phone interview, it was the day for the personal interviews and I was flown into their interviewing location. I had two technical interviews that day and another general, informal get-to-know-you-and-your-work type of interview. For technical interviews, code was to be written on a whiteboard. In one of the technical interviews, I was told to come up with an algorithm for a variation of the classic knapsack problem. This could be solved with a dynamic programming and I coded the same on the whiteboard. It's important to explain how the solution was arrived at. After coding it up, I was asked to analyse its complexity. I'd written a recursive solution and I could only write a recurrence relation for the complexity function, not a closed form. I also told him that an interative solution is also possible and wrote it out too. Being an iterative code, with a simple nested loop, it was also easy to analyse its complexity. The interviewer was actually ok with the recurrence relation for the complexity and didn't bug me on an exact form. He seemed satisfied with my solution and then we moved onto general topics. Interview was quickly over after that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the second technical interview, I was asked a problem on balanced binary search trees. I'd previously implemented an RB Tree and that experience helped me very much for this interview. Without this experience, I couldn't have solved that problem and would've been rejected. I was asked the classic interview problem on sorted-but-rotated array. I knew the solution for this one and it involved binary search. I wrote the solution for this one and the interview was quickly over after that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was told to provide 3 personal references on that day and left for home. About 2 weeks later, I was informed that there would be another technical interview. In this interview, I was asked to implement a simple regex parser. Conceptually, some what simpler than the other interviews, but getting the implementation correct was tricky for this one. I got it right and he was satisfied with the code. I was also then asked about the runtime complexity for the solution. I left the interview confidently.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A week later, I was offered the job. Generally speaking, good programming skills help a lot in getting this job. On top of that, I'd suggest reading the CS algorithms textbook by Cormen. Writing good code, with a clear understanding of its complexity is a must.",

I just used merge sort merge step and wrote java like psuedo code in collabedit.I tried out my code later and it worked fine with no changes [except that I used .length() instead of .length for array length]. But he didn't provide any feedback on what he was looking for. It was correct and complexity was the best possible. One thing I can think of later was I didn't add any method level comments [although I had comments in body] as it was pseudo code. Maybe he was looking for it [pure guess - as I don't know what he wanted]. I left with impression of having done the interview very well [I have worked in the best of companies and got interviewed and interview for those companies] and most of the time you know when you blew it.But I was surprised to get the rejection, 2 days later! Particularly given that question was too easy! Now I am left pondering over what was it? I consider interviews where the perception of interviewer and interviewee differs wildly in terms of performance as bad interviews with negative experience associated with it, as the interviewer didn't communicate his intention with the interviewee properly.

I proceeded with talking about I would started with designing\u2026\u00a0 the backend of the system, for example a ER diagram that would outline the relationship between existing user information and the new information related to the FB Credit system. I was a little nervous at the beginning, but the interviewer jumped in and gave me some help. He then asked me how would the total credit points of a user be calculated based on my design. For that question, I answered how the data is delivered to user from end to end in a multi-tiered web application. Next is the programing question (write a function to convert an ASCII representation of a positive integer to it's numeric value). I had a subtle bug in my code, but in general I got it right. I coded in PHP, the interviewer is satisfied with it since FB uses lots of PHP. The last 5 min was for me to ask him some questions.The interviewer was very professional and helpful during the interview. He was able to follow my thoughts and provide hints.",

After resolving it he gave me the green signal.One of the big problem (I guess one of the main factor in the interview) I faced that as I am OK with English, I was finding difficulty in understanding his accent.

The interviewer did not provide any feedback during the process when I described my \"way of thinking\" and the programming, so I even had to ask whether he was on the line. With phone interview, not feedback is a bit too harsh, imho.Then I was asked to write an iterative solution, and I completed it as well. I did not write the solutions easily, and my way of explaining was not perfectly clear and great, but I solved what I was asked.Then the HR contacted me saying they won't consider me anymore this year.
